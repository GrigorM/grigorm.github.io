The same question confronts us today, in new forms and with even greater urgency and intensity.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">There is a striking contrast between the realities which bring this question home to us and the soothing tones of the dominant ideology. I shall therefore begin by recalling a number of basic facts.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">In the capitalist countries of Europe, taken as a whole, three to four times more wealth is produced today than thirty-five years ago. But it does not take three times more hours of <a id="ind211a"/>work to achieve this more-than-tripled level of production. It requires a much lower quantity.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">In the Federal Republic of <a id="ind219a"/>Germany, the total annual volume of work has <a id="ind707a"/>decreased by 30 per cent since 1955. In <a id="ind201a"/>France, it decreased by 15 per cent in thirty years, and by 10 per cent in the space of six years. The consequences of these gains in productivity are summarized as follows by <a id="ind117a"/>Jacques Delors. In 1946, a twenty-year-old wage-earner could expect to spend a third of his or her waking life at work; by 1975, the figure was a quarter; today, it is less than a fifth. And even then, this figure does not take account of the productivity gains that will be achieved in the future, and holds only for workers employed full-time over the whole year. From this point on, added Delors, French people aged over fifteen will spend less time at work than they do watching television.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The meaning of these figures &#x2013; a meaning which our civilization, press and political representatives prefer not to confront &#x2013; is that we are no longer living in a society of producers, in a work-based civilization. Work is no longer the main social cement, the principal factor of socialization, nor each person&#x2019;s main occupation, their chief source of wealth and <a id="page45"/><a id="ind214a"/>well-being, the meaning and focus of our lives. We are leaving the work-based society behind, but we are exiting backwards from it and walking backwards into a civilization of free <a id="ind629a"/>time, incapable of visualizing and desiring that civilization, and thus incapable of <span class="italic">civilizing</span> the free time which is coming our way; incapable of creating a culture of free time and a culture of chosen activities to take over from and complement the technicist and professional cultures which currently hold centre stage. Everything we do remains dominated by the concern for efficiency, productivity and optimum performance, and hence by the concern to obtain the best possible outcome with the minimum of work in the minimum of time. And we seem intent upon ignoring the fact that the chief consequence of our drive towards efficiency and economic rationalization is that it frees us from work, frees up our time, releases us from the rule of economic rationality itself &#x2013; an outcome which economic rationality is incapable either of evaluating or of endowing with meaning.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">This inability of our societies to establish a civilization based on free time leads to a completely absurd and scandalously unjust distribution of work, disposable time and wealth. All eyes are on the new careers opened up by the micro-electronic revolution and the fundamental transformations it is bringing about in the nature of <a id="ind301a"/>industrial work and, particularly, in the condition of the workers. We are told that repetitive and mindless tasks are tending to disappear from industry, that industrial work is steadily becoming absorbing, responsible work, organized by the workers themselves and varied in its nature, requiring self-starting individuals with initiative and communications skills who are able to acquire and master a wide variety of intellectual and manual disciplines. A new class of craft workers, we are told, is taking over from the old <a id="ind748a"/>working class and realizing the old dream of the producers holding power at the site of production and organizing their own work there, answerable to no one.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">And if you ask what proportion of employees enjoy such new conditions, you are told that today it is only 5 to 10 per cent of workers in industry, but tomorrow it will be 25 per cent, or even 40 to 50 per cent in the metalworking industries.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">This is all very well. But what will become of the 75 per cent of workers in industry and the 50 or 60 per cent of workers in the metalworking industries who will not attain the enviable condition just described? And what will become of those, both male and female, who do not work in industry? Isn&#x2019;t their number growing? Isn&#x2019;t industry laying off labour? Isn&#x2019;t it, in the medium and long term, reducing its workforce? Hasn&#x2019;t the proportion of the active population working in industry fallen from around 40 per cent twenty years ago to around 30 per cent today, and <a id="page46"/><a id="ind220a"/>isn&#x2019;t it forecast that it will be less than 20 per cent in ten years or so? What is to become, then, of this labour which industry&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;&#x201C;releases&#x201D;, if one may put it that way, in order to leave it with just those precious <a id="ind559a"/>multiskilled professionals whose allegiance it gains by offering them a privileged income and status?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">We know the answers to these questions, but we prefer not to face up to their disturbing, dismaying import. In actual fact, for almost half of the active population, the ideology of work is a bad joke and identification with work an impossibility, since the economic system has no need &#x2013; or no regular need &#x2013; of their capacities. The reality disguised by extolling &#x201C;human resources&#x201D; or the work of the new skilled industrial personnel is that stable, full-time, year-round employment throughout an entire lifetime is becoming the privilege of a minority, and that for almost half of the active population, work no longer takes the form of an occupation which integrates them into a productive community and defines their place in society.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The situation in <a id="ind202a"/>France is in no way exceptional in this regard. France, in effect, not only has two and a half million unemployed, but also three million employed people in jobs that are termed &#x201C;outside the norm&#x201D; or atypical: temporary, casual, part-time or illusorily &#x201C;independent&#x201D; jobs. More than two-thirds of the new jobs created in France are in this category, and the situation is no different in the Federal Republic: half of the new jobs created there are part-time or casual; a third of the total workforce have temporary or part-time jobs, with corresponding wages. And when the statistics show a fall in the jobless total, one should not conclude that the economy once again needs a greater volume of work. To reduce the unemployment rate, one can also increase the proportion of part-time and part-waged jobs to the detriment of full-time work. This is what has been happening in the Federal Republic over the last few years.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The situation is even more characteristic in the <a id="ind663a"/>United States and <a id="ind247a"/>Great Britain, where the development to which we are referring began some years earlier. In these two countries, the unemployed and those employed part-time and on a casual basis together represent more than 45 per cent of the active population. In Great Britain, 50 per cent of women and 25 per cent of men &#x2013; that is to say, 36 per cent of the total labour force &#x2013; are in jobs &#x201C;outside the norm&#x201D;. Ninety per cent of the jobs created over a five-year period in Great Britain were casual and/or part-time. In the United States, 60 per cent of the jobs created during the 1980s had wages below the poverty level; the typical income of an American family in which the husband is under twenty-five is 43 per cent lower today than it was in 1973.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Hence between 35 and 50 per cent of the active British, French, <a id="page47"/>German and American populations live on the margins of our so-called work-based civilization, on the fringes of its scale of values, its ethic of productivity and merit. The social system is splitting in two, and giving rise to what is currently termed a &#x201C;dual&#x201D; or &#x201C;two-speed&#x201D; <a id="ind600a"/>society. The effect of this is a very rapid disintegration of the social fabric. At the top, there is frantic competition to land one of those rare stable jobs offering access to a career ladder. This is what a perfectly repulsive advertising slogan refers to as the &#x201C;will to win at any cost&#x201D;. Society is presented in terms of combat sports, social relations are presented in terms of all-out struggle; military vocabulary and warlike images abound. Those, both male and female, who are neither winners nor earners find themselves ejected on to the margins of a society which has nothing to offer them and with which they have few reasons to identify. The violence of that society provokes counter-violence, disaffection, and aggressively regressive or reactionary nostalgia.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">This disintegration of a fragmented society brings us back to a fundamental problem: what form must a society take in which full-time work on the part of all its citizens is no longer either necessary or economically useful? What priorities other than economic ones must it accord itself? How must it proceed so that productivity gains and savings in working time redound to everyone&#x2019;s advantage? How can it best redistribute all the socially useful work in such a way that everyone may work &#x2013; but work less and better &#x2013; while receiving their share of the socially produced wealth?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The prevailing tendency is to brush aside such questions and pose the problem the other way round &#x2013; to ask: how can we proceed so that, in spite of productivity gains, the economy still consumes as much work as it did in the past? How are we to proceed so that new paid activities come to take the place of the time which is set free, in overall terms, by productivity gains? To what new fields of activity can commodity exchange be extended so as somehow to replace other jobs lost elsewhere in industry and industrialized <a id="ind554a"/>services?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">You know the answer to these questions, an answer for which the <a id="ind664a"/>United States and <a id="ind316a"/>Japan have shown the way: the only field in which it is possible, <span class="italic">within a liberal economy</span>, to create a large number of jobs for the future is that of personal services. There might be no limits to the development of employment if it were possible to transform into acts of paid service those activities which people have hitherto performed for themselves. Economists speak in this connection of &#x201C;new employment-richer growth&#x201D;, of &#x201C;tertiarization&#x201D; of the economy, and of the development of a &#x201C;service society&#x201D; which will take over from &#x201C;industrial society&#x201D;.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">But we shall see that this way of seeking to rescue the wage-earning society raises problems and presents contradictions which deserve a <a id="page48"/>place in the forefront of public debate and political thinking. What is the content, what is the meaning, of the majority of the activities currently being talked of for conversion into professionalized and monetized services? It is easy to show that the professionalization of these services no longer obeys the same logic as the economic development of the past.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">In the past, economic growth did, in effect, have &#x201C;productive substitution&#x201D; as its engine: tasks which people had for centuries performed in their domestic sphere were progressively transferred to industry and service industries which possessed machines more efficient than those to which a household had access. Industrial production and industrialized services thus replaced &#x201C;own-use&#x201D; production within the home, and supplanted individuals&#x2019; provision for themselves. No one spins their own wool any longer, or weaves their cloth, makes their clothes, bakes their bread, makes their jams, builds their house, and so forth, since all these activities, which people still frequently performed for themselves two or three generations ago, are carried on more quickly, and often better, by industries employing wage-labourers. And because industrialization allows us to do a host of things more quickly and often better with less work, everyone can, in the end, buy more goods and services with the wages for one hour of their work than they would be able to produce by and for themselves in the space of one hour. In other words, industrialization has saved working time for everyone, throughout society, and the working time saved has been re-employed to a large extent <span class="italic">within the economy</span> to produce extra wealth which only industrialization enables us to conceive and create.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">But the question the present course of development raises is precisely this: is it still possible to re-employ <span class="italic">within the economy</span> the working time saved thanks to the micro-electronic revolution? Do the new jobs created in personal services provide more efficiently &#x2013; that is to say, <span class="italic">better and more quickly</span> &#x2013; the services which people previously performed for themselves? If you examine the great majority of the jobs created in the <a id="ind665a"/>United States over the last ten years or so, you can see that this is not the case at all. These jobs, which have made it possible to reduce the unemployment rate, do not correspond to what we referred to a moment ago as the &#x201C;productive substitution&#x201D; of waged work for individuals&#x2019; own production for themselves. The function of these jobs, in most cases, is, rather, the following: the two, three or four hours you spent up to now mowing your lawn, walking your dog, doing your shopping, buying your newspaper, doing the housework or taking care of your children are transferred to one or more service-providers who take over these activities in exchange for payment. They do nothing which you could not do just as well yourself. They simply free three or four hours of your time by allowing <a id="page49"/>you to buy three or four hours of theirs. Economists call this kind of transfer &#x201C;equivalent substitution&#x201D;, and even Adam Smith, in his day, stressed that such a transfer is economically &#x201C;unproductive&#x201D;. To buy someone else&#x2019;s time to increase your own leisure or comfort is merely to purchase the work of a servant. The majority of the jobs created in the <a id="ind666a"/>United States are servants&#x2019; jobs, as indeed are a large proportion of those which, in <a id="ind317a"/>Japan, explain the low rate of unemployment there. But who is interested in purchasing, and who can afford to purchase, the services of the <a id="ind550a"/>new servants? This is the embarrassing question which those &#x2013; including trade unionists &#x2013; who regard <a id="ind321a"/>job-creation as an end in itself do not ask.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Suppose, for a moment, that the new servants are in the same position as you &#x2013; that is to say, for one hour of their work you have to pay them as much as you earn in one hour of yours. From an economic point of view, it would then be more rational for you to work one hour less yourself and look after your own domestic tasks, either individually or within a service-exchange co-operative formed with your neighbours. You will perhaps object that your decision is not entirely determined by the economic aspect: even if one hour&#x2019;s servant work costs you as much as you earn yourself in an hour, you are prepared to pay that price to be rid of all kinds of chores. But if this is the case, <span class="italic">you are claiming the privilege of unloading your chores on to someone else</span>; you are implicitly asserting that there must be people prepared to take on your chores, <span class="italic">people who are fit only to do what you find boring or repugnant</span> &#x2013; in short, people whose vocation is to serve. In a word, inferiors. But why might there be such people? In what social conditions are people prepared to take on other people&#x2019;s chores on a professional basis, as it were, in addition to their own chores? And where do you get the extra purchasing power which enables you to buy increasing quantities of personal services from a growing host of service-providers?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Most economists, and even a number of trade unionists, give the following reply: <a id="ind23a"/>automation brings down the relative prices of a great many products. This <a id="ind482a"/>fall in prices increases purchasing power and enables people to afford household services. The reasoning is impeccable, but an essential aspect of the question is left out of account: <span class="italic">where does the fall in relative prices due to automation come from?</span> The answer is that it comes from <span class="italic">automated enterprises having reduced their &#x201C;payroll&#x201D;, from their having reduced the volume of wages they distribute</span>. They have reduced the &#x201C;payroll&#x201D; <span class="italic">by reducing their workforce</span>. The people who now have additional purchasing power by virtue of the fall in prices are obviously not those who have lost their old jobs. Only those who have kept their permanent jobs, which are often relatively well-paid ones with a higher status, have additional purchasing power. Only they can afford the new commodity <a id="page50"/>services provided by the sector in which millions of wage-earners are now supposed to find jobs.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">This is the true meaning of the development of personal services. These services are developing, and are likely to create a large number of jobs, because in most cases those who perform an hour of <a id="ind130a"/>domestic labour in your stead earn much less than you can earn in an hour of <span class="italic">your</span> work. Personal services are developing as a result of the <a id="ind452a"/>pauperization of a growing mass of people, a pauperization found both in Western Europe and in North America. Social and economic inequality between those who provide personal services and those who purchase them has become the engine of employment growth. This is based on a dualization of society, on a kind of South-Africanization, as though the colonial model were finding a foothold in the metropolitan heartlands.<a id="c05-nts2a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c05_r1GrigorMa3613logrigormalogmailcom.htm#c05-nts2"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Hence we see conditions which prevailed a hundred and fifty years ago, at the outset of the industrial era &#x2013; a time when the level of consumption was ten times lower than it is today, and there was neither universal suffrage nor compulsory schooling &#x2013; becoming re-established in the post-industrial age. At that period, too, at the height of the unfettered market economy, one-sixth of the population was reduced to seeking employment as domestic <a id="ind551a"/>servants in the houses of the rich, and a quarter got by as best they could from occasional work. But in the last century that quarter and that sixth were made up of illiterate rustics and ruined artisans. Democracy did not as yet exist in any practical sense, and there was no right to education, or to equality of opportunity.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Today, by contrast, we have an explosive paradox on our hands: on the one hand, our governments want 80 per cent of young people to leave school with a high standard of leaving qualification; but on the other, in keeping with the ideology of work for work&#x2019;s sake, they want to see an enormous <a id="ind654a"/>underclass of servants develop to ease the lives and leisure of the better-off classes. What else are those governments doing, in effect, when they reduce taxes on higher incomes on the pretext that alleviating the burden on the rich will create jobs, whilst fiscal transfers in favour of the poorer members of society create hardly any? If, indeed, you increase the resources of the poor, they will merely increase their consumption of current, industrialized products and services, the labour content of which is low. Increasing the disposable income of the rich, by contrast, will increase the consumption of luxury goods and, most importantly, of personal services which have a high labour content, but the economic rationality of which, in overall social terms, is feeble, if not downright non-existent.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">In other words, from now on, job <a id="ind322a"/>creation depends mainly not on <span class="italic">economic</span> activity, but on <span class="italic">anti-economic</span> activity; not on the <span class="italic">productive</span> substitution of waged work for individuals&#x2019; private production, but on its <a id="page51"/><span class="italic"><a id="ind735a"/>counterproductive</span> substitution. It is no longer the function of job-creation to make savings of working time across society as a whole, but to waste working time for the greater comfort of those who have money to spend. The aim is not to reduce the quantity of work per unit of product or service by maximizing productivity; the aim is now to reduce productivity and maximize the quantity of work by developing a tertiary sector which does not create wealth &#x2013; what economists delicately describe as &#x201C;a more employment-rich pattern of growth&#x201D;.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">It will perhaps be objected that immense needs remain unmet, and a different distribution of resources would enable us to create millions of public or semi-public jobs which would employ qualified personnel, decently paid, and even offer the less well-off a host of services which they currently lack: assistance to mothers and the aged, home helps, home care, cr&#x00E8;ches &#x2013; not to mention organized leisure services, popular or &#x201C;third age&#x201D; universities, and so on. All these things can certainly be found in <a id="ind539a"/>Scandinavia, organized by local authorities, and they provide a great number of jobs, staffed by a workforce that is mainly female. Yet these services, which do not meet needs <span class="italic">for which there is effective economic demand</span>, obviously cannot be profitable. They do not obey an economic logic. They have to be financed out of taxes &#x2013; that is, by deductions from the purchasing power of the population. These services are the reason why the rate of taxation in Scandinavia is between 55 and 65 per cent, as opposed to 43 per cent in <a id="ind203a"/>France.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The Scandinavian model of locally provided household services does, however, raise an even more fundamental question than that of financing: we have to ask to what extent it is right to substitute the services of paid professionals for activities which each of us could just as easily perform ourselves if we had the free time to do so. In other words, to what extent are the needs to which these services are responding themselves the product of a <span class="italic">lack of time</span>? To what extent would a policy of reducing hours of work &#x2013; of all work, including household work &#x2013; reduce not only working time, but also the need to have recourse to professional services, whether provided commercially or otherwise? Would not the thirty-hour, and then the twenty-eight- or twenty-four-hour week, with equitable distribution of domestic tasks between partners, enable service-exchange networks to be organized independently in housing estates, neighbourhoods or local areas, and permit the self-organization of mutual-aid groups based not on money payments but on exchanges of time? By dint of monetizing, professionalizing and transforming into jobs the few remaining production and service activities we still perform for ourselves, might we not reduce our capacity to look after ourselves almost to the point where it disappears, thus undermining the foundations of existential autonomy, not to mention <a id="page52"/>the foundations of lived sociality and the fabric of human relationships?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Lastly, and most importantly, if, as is the tendency today, the governing class defines <a id="ind323a"/>job-creation as its main aim, where will this transformation of all activities into paid activities (with remuneration as their sole rationale and maximum productivity as their goal) finally end? How long will the extremely fragile barriers which still prevent the professionalization of motherhood or fatherhood be able to hold out? When shall we see the commercial procreation of embryos, the sale of children, or a trade in organs? Are we not already monetizing, professionalizing and selling not only those things and services we <span class="italic">produce</span>, but also what we <span class="italic">are</span> and what we cannot produce at will or detach from ourselves? In other words, are we not already transforming ourselves into commodities and treating life as one means among others rather than the supreme end which all means must subserve?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">To sum up: the basic problem which confronts us is that of getting beyond the economy and &#x2013; though this amounts to the same thing &#x2013; of getting beyond paid work. Economic rationalization frees time, and will continue to do so. Consequently, it is no longer possible to make citizens&#x2019; income dependent upon the quantity of work the economy requires. It is no longer possible, either, to continue to make paid work the main source of each person&#x2019;s identity, or of their life&#x2019;s meaning.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The casualization of employment and the dualization of society are the perverse forms assumed by the liberation of time which this social system refuses to acknowledge or take into account.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The task of a Left, if there is indeed to be one, consists, then, in transforming this release of time into a new freedom and new rights: the right of everyone, male or female, to earn their living by working, but by working less and less, and better and better, while receiving their full share of the socially produced wealth; and the right to work discontinuously and intermittently, without losing their full income during breaks from work, in such a way as to open up new spaces for activities that have no economic ends and to grant these activities, which are not engaged in for payment, a dignity and a value both for individuals and for society itself.</p><h2 class="B_HEAD">Notes</h2><div class="note_hang"><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart" id="c05-nts1"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c05_r1GrigorMa3613logrigormalogmailcom.htm#c05-nts1a">1.</a> This paper was delivered to the Cercle Condorcet in Paris in March 1990.
