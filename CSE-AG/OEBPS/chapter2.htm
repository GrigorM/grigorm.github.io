Which side are you on?&#x201D; For those who, today, ask themselves in what way the Left still differs from the Right &#x2013; or even in what regard the <a id="ind359a"/>Left-Right distinction still has meaning in Western societies &#x2013; this evangelical summons offers not an answer, but a method: it states as axiomatic that every society is divided into two by a central conflict, and that no one can avoid being part of that conflict.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">Yet this central conflict remains to be defined. Who are the oppressors and who are the oppressed, who are the dominators and who are the dominated, and what is at stake in the conflict between them? In <a id="ind345a"/>Latin America the matter seems relatively simple. It is not immediately obvious in Western Europe and North America, where ideologies lag behind cultural, social and technical changes, and the <a id="ind471a"/>political machines continue to fight over issues and on terrains which correspond less and less to the new dimensions of the conflict and its new stakes. As a result of this lag, it is not the opposition between Right and Left that is losing its pertinence, but the (media, party political) opposition between the <a id="page16"/>political apparatuses which claim allegiance to one or the other. Increasingly, the real frontier between Left and <a id="ind529a"/>Right does not run between these apparatuses but, rather, between the parties which occupy the institutional centre stage, on the one hand, and the movements rising up on their margins and contesting them, on the other. The established political organizations are falling into discredit, except where they succeed in incorporating, in a process of renovation, the themes with which the new social actors are now outflanking them.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">The discredit into which the established political organizations are falling is clearly visible in all the developed countries, and the conservative parties find themselves in a crisis more difficult in some respects to overcome than the one facing those who claim to be of the Left. The classical Right has, in effect, always been obliged to defend the power of the dominant class in the name of a conception of the general interest and the social order which transcends that class. In modern capitalist societies, it has to embody both the demands of capital &#x2013; for maximum profitability and competitiveness, technical and economic <a id="ind409a"/><a id="ind61a"/>modernization, domination of the process of reproduction and the orientation of development &#x2013; and traditional values &#x2013; family, work, fatherland, order and authority &#x2013; which are constantly being undermined by the logic of the commodity, expertocracy and the invasion of the life-milieu by megatechnologies.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">Particularly in periods of radical change and accelerated technical innovation, capitalism breaks down the social order, shatters cohesion and &#x201C;identities&#x201D;, sweeps away traditional norms and values, and dissolves those communities, allegiances and exchanges that were formerly felt to be entirely natural by bringing them under a system of technical constraints and legal formalization. This is what <a id="ind267a"/>Habermas calls the &#x201C;colonization of the lifeworld&#x201D; by the &#x201C;economic and administrative subsystems&#x201D;.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">Besides prompting opposition from the Left (to which we shall return), this colonization of the lifeworld, this destruction of the intuitive patterns of interpretation and traditional ethical codes, gives rise to a <span class="italic">conformist revolt</span>, which the Right has at all costs to represent and channel, on pain of losing its social base. In a society undergoing complexification and radical change, the Right is thus faced with the difficult task of having to represent <span class="italic">both</span> aspirations for order, stability, security and the preservation of traditional cultural norms and conceptions <span class="italic">and</span> the modernizing and expansionist demands which are causing capital, in order to satisfy its need for profit, to reshape spheres of activity and life formerly spared by commodity logic.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">In consequence, the Right is constantly threatened with break-up. If it identifies too openly with the modernizing dynamic of capital, it will <a id="page17"/><a id="ind475a"/>provoke the emergence on its Right of a traditionalist, populist <a id="ind98a"/>conservative force. If, on the other hand, it identifies with the conservative resistance to modernization, it will give rise, in the best of cases, to a decadent, corporatist and immobilist <a id="ind662a"/>state such as the <a id="ind536a"/>Salazar or <a id="ind208a"/>Franco regimes, or the <a id="ind252a"/>Greece of the colonels.<a id="c02-nts1a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts1"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">In the past, the Right could resolve its dilemma by supporting the modernizing strategy of capital in the name of an aggressive and conquering <a id="ind424a"/>nationalism which to some extent compensated, by patriotically extolling the national community, for the dislocation of traditional systems of allegiance and life. We know that this solution has become impossible today. Far from being able to provide a cover for capitalist modernization (except, perhaps, in an imperial nation that was <a id="ind507a"/>economically and militarily dominant on a planetary scale, an ambition which is becoming impracticable) and to compensate for it, the extolling of national grandeur, traditions and identity is today a form of resistance and reaction against that modernization, against the globalization of <a id="ind378a"/><a id="ind387a"/>markets, capital and the division of labour. Chauvinism, <a id="ind501a"/>racism, <a id="ind526a"/>fundamentalism and xenophobia &#x2013; which, in the past, could provide support for the imperial expansionism of a conquering national-capitalism &#x2013; are today regressive reactions to an essentially technocratic and stateless capitalism. That capitalism cares nothing for traditional nationalism and military power. The weapons of its imperialism are technical advance, conquest of markets and information control. The Right is obliged to find themes which provide an outlet for conservative revolt while serving the cause of capitalist modernization. It found them first in <a id="ind537a"/>Scandinavia, then in the USA, and then in the rest of Europe. They are <a id="ind195a"/>fiscal revolt, anti-bureaucratic sentiment and the rejection of <a id="ind614a"/>state interventionism.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">These themes are interesting on account of their ambivalence. On the one hand, they quite clearly have a neo-liberal dimension of rehabilitating free competition in a free market between free individuals and free enterprises. They restore a positive role to an <a id="ind153a"/>economic <a id="ind435a"/>liberalism which, for more than a century and a half, has progressively been held in check by the labour movement and the social state. It was in that struggle to impose restrictive rules on the free workings of the market &#x2013; which both permit and demand the maximization of efficiency and profit &#x2013; and to define areas from which the market was excluded that the <a id="ind347a"/>Left took shape and developed. Gradually, the Left has come to circumscribe more and more the space within which free competition and the pursuit of maximum productivity are given free rein. In other words, it has withdrawn from the rule of <a id="ind157a"/>economic rationality larger and larger fields (such as health, education, housing, the family, old age provision, etc.) to which the priorities and criteria of the pursuit of maximum returns were not applicable.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart"><a id="page18"/>The <a id="ind577a"/>social <a id="ind613a"/>state has, none the less, left intact the mode of operation of the economic system and the hegemonic dynamic of its type of rationality. The restriction of the sphere in which that rationality is allowed free rein is entirely dependent on strengthening the state&#x2019;s powers of intervention. Strengthening those powers has not given rise to a different public space, to other forms of sociality, other forms of life and work governed by an autonomous rationality and values. Thus the redistributive action and the regulatory interventions of the state have been regarded by their beneficiaries as representing &#x201C;social gains&#x201D;, as a bureaucratic guardianship, and as the despoiling of the more &#x201C;high-powered&#x201D; for the benefit of the less able.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">Habermas has described, on several occasions, how &#x201C;an ever denser net of legal norms, of governmental and para-governmental bureaucracies is spread over the daily life of its potential and actual clients&#x201D;; how &#x201C;the lifeworld is regimented, dissected, controlled, and watched over&#x201D; by &#x201C;the professionalization and scientization of social services&#x201D; and by &#x201C;normalization and surveillance&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;down to its very finest capillary ramifications in everyday communication&#x201D;; he concludes: &#x201C;the establishment of forms of life that&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;open up arenas for individual self-realization and spontaneity&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;cannot be reached via the direct route of putting political programs into legal and administrative form&#x201D;.<a id="c02-nts2a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts2"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">In so far as it is based on the consolidated <span class="italic">domination</span> of daily life by normalizing and formalistic administrative bodies, the <a id="ind694a"/><a id="ind695a"/>welfare state is as far as it could possibly be from the libertarian aspirations for individual and collective liberation which are one of the founding dimensions of the Left. Instead of expanding the power social individuals have over their lives, over the modes and outcomes of their social co-operation, the welfare state, running parallel in this with capital, subjects them to its own power and deprives them of their space of <a id="ind33a"/>autonomy in exchange for the forms of security they are guaranteed. That is why &#x201C;Today the [social-statist] legitimists are the true conservatives, who want to stabilize what has been achieved&#x201D; by attempting to find &#x201C;a point of equilibrium between the development of a welfare state and modernization based on a market economy&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x201D;. This type of programme &#x201C;fails to recognize, however, the potentials for resistance accumulating in&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;communicatively structured lifeworlds&#x201D;, made conscious of their fragility and autonomy by their &#x201C;progressive bureaucratic erosion&#x201D;.<a id="c02-nts3a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts3"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">It is easy to see how the <a id="ind530a"/>Right can exploit this situation. With the established Left bogged down in a <a id="ind579a"/>social-statism whose fiscal limits &#x2013; and bureaucratic burdensomeness &#x2013; are becoming evident, the Right can claim the inheritance of the Left&#x2019;s libertarian aspirations for a politics which dismantles the welfare state, lightens the fiscal burden, &#x201C;de-regulates&#x201D; and abandons the development of a complex society to <a id="page19"/><a id="ind212a"/><a id="ind379a"/><a id="ind385a"/>market forces reputed to be &#x201C;neutral&#x201D; and &#x201C;free&#x201D; because they lie beyond the scope and conscious determination of human beings. To the <a id="ind360a"/>Right&#x2019;s traditional social base this politics promises enhanced possibilities of social promotion and individual <a id="ind719a"/>success (&#x201C;effort&#x201D; and &#x201C;merit&#x201D; will be better rewarded thanks to the reformed tax system); to the new salaried strata and to a not inconsiderable fraction of the <a id="ind558a"/>skilled workers and technicians it offers the rehabilitation of success through work, within an alliance of &#x201C;winners&#x201D; &#x2013; an alliance of &#x201C;workers&#x201D; and &#x201C;entrepreneurs&#x201D; against the &#x201C;idlers&#x201D; and &#x201C;incompetents&#x201D; who are seeking to live off the work of others by way of social benefits. The laws of the market demand efficiency and optimum performance; the competitiveness of the economy depends on that of each enterprise: &#x201C;we are at war&#x201D;, and everyone has to be fired with &#x201C;the will to win&#x201D;. A nation of winners cannot grieve over the fate of the weak or those who are unable to keep up; it will function all the better the more effectively it marginalizes these &#x201C;new poor&#x201D;, from whom &#x2013; as was not the case with the proletarian masses of the last century &#x2013; it has nothing to fear and no benefit to derive, except perhaps in so far as they might provide cheap services for the most able.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart"><span class="italic">In a context in which there can no longer be stable full-time jobs for all</span>, this extolling of maximum effort and glorification of <a id="ind178a"/><a id="ind657a"/>employment as a source of social identity and national wealth and greatness will succeed in clouding the political waters by disconcertingly overturning the previous system of allegiances: as a result, the class of <a id="ind682a"/>skilled wage-earners with stable jobs will be induced to behave as <span class="italic">jealous proprietors</span> of that rare commodity, employment, and to ally with the traditional middle classes and the <a id="ind62a"/>modern employers to defend their jobs and wages against the pressure from a growing mass of unemployed workers, both native and non-native, and from competing enterprises.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">The ideology of effort and individual merit, the defence of jobs and identification with work, have thus become right-wing themes, enabling blocs of the working class to be won over to a new national-productivist alliance in favour of liberal-capitalist <a id="ind410a"/>modernization. The old <a id="ind348a"/>Left has seen a crucial part of its ideology and social base stolen by the Right. The terrains it occupied in the past are no longer rightly its own; they are no longer terrains of the Left. Hence the perplexity and scepticism regarding the pertinence of the Right-Left divide. Hence also the obvious fact that if there is a Left, it has to be sought on other terrains than those of national-productivism, the ideology of work, of the wage-earning society, of <a id="ind580a"/>social-statism and a &#x201C;collective utilitarianism&#x201D;, as <a id="ind53a"/>Alain Caill&#x00E9; would put it, for whom collective well-being is to be achieved only by renouncing the <a id="ind26a"/>autonomy of the subject.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">It is in terms of this latter theme of the autonomy of the subject (in <a id="ind389a"/>Marx&#x2019;s language, &#x201C;the free development of individuality&#x201D;) that a Left <a id="page20"/>political orientation has to be defined today. The question <a id="ind476a"/>post-industrial societies face is, in fact, the question of <span class="italic">the use that will be made of the savings of labour</span> which ensue from the development of technologies. The conservative response, shared by the old Left and the various strands of the <a id="ind361a"/>Right, consists in counting on the indefinite expansion of the sphere of waged and commodity activities to save the wage-based society and open up new fields of profitable investment for capital. We know that this is a solution that can be achieved only on the basis of a dual society, with well-paid <a id="ind683a"/>wage-earners with stable conditions of employment in the highly <a id="ind54a"/>capital-intensive sector, which produces the greater part of the <a id="ind508a"/>economic surplus, and precarious and very <a id="ind369a"/>low-paid workers in an increasingly extensive <a id="ind553a"/>service sector which, culturally, presents the redhibitory defect of monetizing, economicizing, professionalizing and generally alienating from subjects the activities by which they produce and reproduce themselves, and by which they take control of their lives as autonomous existences.<a id="c02-nts4a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts4"><sup class="frac">4</sup></a></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">By contrast, the response which will henceforth define the Left, and by which the Left will define itself as such, consists in viewing the savings of <a id="ind750a"/>working <a id="ind627a"/>time as a <span class="italic">liberation of time</span>, by virtue of which social individuals should be able to emancipate themselves from the constraints of <a id="ind158a"/>economic rationality embodied in capital (i.e. in the domination of dead over living labour). To emancipate themselves not by abolishing capital and the sphere of economically rational commodity activities (as the communist or fundamentalist anti-moderns or pre-moderns imagine), but by assigning them a limited and subaltern function in the development of society. In other words, the societal objective of productivity gains must be to bring about a contraction of the sphere governed by economic calculation and an expansion of the self-determined, self-organized spheres of activity in which human faculties can develop freely.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">To use the potentialities of <a id="ind624a"/>technology not to reinforce the domination of the apparatuses over people&#x2019;s lives, consumer choices and time, but to free social individuals from the constraints of the social megamachine and increase their power over their own lives and the development of society &#x2013; this is the alternative which today defines the Left-Right divide or, as <a id="ind631a"/>Alain Touraine puts it, the &#x201C;central conflict&#x201D;. This central conflict develops on many terrains and in multiple forms (one can easily imagine how it impacts upon international policy options regarding economic &#x201C;co-operation&#x201D; and &#x201C;development&#x201D;), all of which, however, share a &#x201C;central stake, namely the use society will make of its own capacity to act upon itself&#x201D;; the use it will make, in particular, of technology and &#x201C;of the symbolic goods it produces in vast quantities&#x201D;.

There is a central conflict and a central stake, but <span class="italic">there is no longer a central front</span>. The reappropriation struggle is essentially a struggle to <span class="italic">withdraw and shield from</span> the (technical, administrative, financial, commercial, urban, etc.) apparatuses spaces which a growing productivity makes potentially available.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">These spaces are essentially temporal.

The reappropriation to which the struggle must be directed is, then, first and foremost, the <span class="italic">social and individual reappropriation of working time</span> which the economic apparatus is forced to leave vacant for want of being able to make it produce surplus-value &#x2013; time which will become freed, disposable time only if social individuals are able to make it time for <span class="italic">their</span> own activities, for their own lives and their own ends.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">To force capital and, more generally, the economic apparatus to leave the savings of working time at the free disposal of a society in which economically rational activities can no longer be preponderant; to fight for the expansion of spaces of autonomy in which economic purposes and commodity logic no longer prevail; and to render economic, technical, organizational and urban development favourable to the reappropriation by individuals of time, of their environment, of their model of consumption and their mode of social co-operation: such is, broadly, the perspective which is opening up (or would open up) for a Left which defined itself in terms of the decision to <span class="italic">seize the emancipatory potential of <a id="ind477a"/>post-industrial civilization</span>.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">It will be objected, no doubt, that all this presupposes the desire and the <span class="italic">capacity</span> on the part of individuals to reappropriate time. But this is precisely the nature of the cultural change that is currently under way. This development continues to be ignored in <a id="ind200a"/>France, where the political class, the media and the public services persist in presenting professional, social and financial <a id="ind720a"/>success as everyone&#x2019;s main preoccupation <a id="page22"/><a id="ind213a"/>and principal &#x201C;source of identity&#x201D;. The ideal they present is that of the professionally qualified specialist, highly paid, employed full-time and for life &#x2013; in short, the norm which was that of the wage-based society. French society and public opinion will not have it that for the majority of people that norm no longer represents either a possibility or an aspiration, but merely corresponds to the ruling class&#x2019;s political need to perpetuate the <span class="italic">domination</span> which the wage relation and the competition to land one of these full-time jobs (which we know, however, are available in insufficient numbers) enable it to exert over people&#x2019;s lives.

None of these partial systems can perform any integrative role which extends beyond its specific, partial function. Socialization no longer guarantees individuals a <span class="italic">place</span> in a &#x201C;social order&#x201D;, no longer ensures a sense of belonging and an &#x201C;identity&#x201D;. Each person occupies multiple functions, roles and places without being able to identify with any one of them; in consequence, everyone has to construct an identity for him- or herself, to define the right line of conduct for him- or herself. The &#x201C;<a id="ind281a"/>quest for identity&#x201D; is never-ending; adolescence never quite comes to an end: one&#x2019;s home and one&#x2019;s sexual relationships, as well as one&#x2019;s line of work and particular job, are all regarded as <a id="page23"/>temporary, while one &#x201C;waits&#x201D; for something which &#x201C;actually&#x201D; corresponds to what one is looking for &#x2013; a fulfilling, socially useful activity which has meaning and prospects, an activity with which one can identify.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">Not only does &#x201C;the rise in <a id="ind753a"/>youth <a id="ind660a"/>unemployment, the difficulty of finding even a place as an apprentice, never mind a real training&#x201D; turn every occupational choice into a random one, with no relation to a sense of vocation or life-project, but</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">none of the professional roles offered provides sufficient consistency to justify becoming attached to it.&#x2026;&#x00A0;Adolescent styles of behaviour also become common among adults: experimentation, change, the rejection of a lifelong occupation, the desire to go on learning and extend one&#x2019;s horizon and not get bogged down in routine.&#x2026;&#x00A0;How can the individual find his/her place in society without giving up his/her aspirations and potentialities?&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;The ideal pursued is one of continued fulfilment, of openness and availability.&#x2026;&#x00A0;These tendencies also reflect the pressure, imposed by ever more rapid sociocultural change, to remain mobile and flexible</p></div><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">&#x2013; and, of course, the way employment has been rendered more precarious.<a id="c02-nts8a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts8"><sup class="frac">8</sup></a></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">Individuals have been &#x201C;forced into <a id="ind34a"/>autonomy&#x201D;, writes <a id="ind278a"/>Karl Horning, as if echoing Sartre&#x2019;s phrase, &#x201C;condemned to be free&#x201D;.<a id="c02-nts9a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts9"><sup class="frac">9</sup></a> And one can immediately see to what extent, in this situation, the opposition between <a id="ind349a"/>Left and <a id="ind295a"/><a id="ind362a"/>Right political options will have to be radicalized. From a Left point of view, the freedom (or autonomy) to which individuals are &#x201C;condemned&#x201D; does not have to be seen as a curse. As a pure vacant space, undetermined in so far as it is simply <span class="italic">given</span> by the social system, that freedom must, on the contrary, be <span class="italic">seized</span> as an opportunity and transformed into an enhanced capacity on the part of subjects to &#x201C;produce&#x201D; and realize themselves, individually and collectively, in the form of projects for which they may assume responsibility. In this perspective, the fact of employment becoming precarious is to be interpreted as a loosening of the grip which economically determined work had in the past on the life of the population. It signifies that the economy no longer needs the full and full-time employment of everyone, male and female; and that the object of social policies must be to make the time that has been freed from work effectively available to everyone. The increasingly intermittent, discontinuous, secondary character of the wage relation must be transformed into a new freedom, a new right for each person to interrupt his or her professional activity. And this, of course, demands the guaranteeing of an income which is no longer directly related to the number of hours worked.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">On the other hand, any conception which sees autonomy as a calamity, <a id="page24"/>against which the appropriate reaction would be to seek refuge in <a id="ind527a"/>religious fundamentalism, the commands of an authoritarian order or the constraining exigencies of the economic or technical pursuit of maximum efficiency, will have to be considered a Rightist one. None of these forms of &#x201C;escape from freedom&#x201D; will, however, be able to rid complex, modern societies of the &#x201C;burden&#x201D; of liberty, nor establish within them stable &#x201C;<a id="ind280a"/>identity-bestowing&#x201D; structures.<a id="c02-nts10a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts10"><sup class="frac">10</sup></a> When, as is currently the case, (national, social, occupational, ethnic or religious) identity is invoked and extolled on all fronts, this proves that it <span class="italic">is in doubt</span>, that it is no longer self-evident, that it is already lost. Individual being and social being no longer coincide &#x2013; and can no longer coincide &#x2013; because this latter is no longer &#x2013; and no longer can be &#x2013; a belonging of the individual in his or her entirety to society and community &#x2013; in work, lifestyle, ethics, milieu and position within the social totality &#x2013; as was the case in a guild-based society or within the industrial working class, with its culture, solidarities, associations and counter-society. In complex modern society, the differentiation of spheres of activity brings with it a differentiation of the dimensions of existence, and prevents the subject from seeking his or her unity in any of them. The multiplicity of his or her roles introduces a fissure between each of these and him- or herself.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">Once this process of differentiation has begun, any attempt to put the clock back, to return to a highly integrative social-<a id="ind605a"/>communitary <span class="italic">order</span>, re-establishing the unity of spheres of activity and spheres of life by subordinating them to the rationality of one of those spheres, will have an inevitably totalitarian character: it will block the society&#x2019;s capacity to evolve &#x2013; its &#x201C;capacity to act upon itself&#x201D;, as <a id="ind633a"/>Touraine puts it; or, in <a id="ind268a"/>Habermas&#x2019;s terminology, the possibility of the lifeworld reacting back on the system. Whether it be fundamentalist, Leninist or fascist, such a social-communitary order will always have a <a id="ind104a"/>corporatist structure, even if this means dominating the different spheres of activity by placing &#x201C;elites&#x201D; recruited and promoted on lines of ideological conformism and political loyalty at the head of each of them.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">The differentiation of spheres of activity &#x2013; and, hence, modernity &#x2013; will remain unfinished as long as one particular sphere can subordinate others to its logic; as long, for example, as the requirements of capital valorization impose their orientation and imprint on technology, on the definition of needs, on the model of consumption, on the organization of work, and so forth; or as long as the domestication of the &#x201C;economic subsystem&#x201D; is based on a reinforced domination of the &#x201C;administrative-bureaucratic subsystem&#x201D;; or as long as techno-science colonizes the lifeworld with its apparatuses, and deprives people of the possibility of developing living and lived relations to their environment, to space, to time and to their bodies.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart"><a id="page25"/>The completion of modernity, and thus the task &#x2013; in essence still incomplete &#x2013; by which the Left defines itself consists in putting an end to the situation in which one or more spheres of activity dominate the others, and preventing all the subsystems (apparatuses, in Touraine&#x2019;s terminology) from encroaching on the self-determined spheres of life and activity. It is this <span class="italic">domination</span> by <a id="ind159a"/><a id="ind509a"/>economic rationality, embodied in capital and its techno-<a id="ind49a"/>bureaucratic apparatuses, which defines capitalism, not the existence of an economic sphere governed by the logic of profitability and competition. It is the abolition of that domination, not the abolition of capital and the market, which will mark our passing beyond capitalism. Any elimination of the relative autonomy of a sphere of activity reduces the complexity of society and its development potential. The aim can only be to circumscribe, to restrict the field in which each type of rationality is permitted to express itself in an unfettered way. As <a id="ind634a"/>Alain Touraine continues to point out, this is the objective of the grass-roots social movements.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">In the same vein, despite insurmountable methodological differences, <a id="ind269a"/>Habermas notes that &#x201C;only the dissident critics of industrial society start from the premise that the lifeworld is equally threatened by commodification <span class="italic">and</span> bureaucratization&#x201D; &#x2013; that is, the dictatorship over needs exerted by capital and the state. &#x201C;They [the dissident critics] are the only ones to demand that the inner dynamic of subsystems regulated by money and power be broken&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;by forms of organization that are closer to the base and self-administered&#x201D;; it is &#x201C;not only capitalism but the interventionist state itself&#x201D; that now has to be &#x201C;socially contained&#x201D;. This requires &#x201C;a completely altered relationship between autonomous, self-organized public spheres on the one hand and domains of action regulated by money and administrative power on the other&#x201D;. In other words, the regulatory mechanisms of the state and the economy must themselves be reflectively regulated by a social instance which &#x201C;could make [them]&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;sufficiently sensitive to&#x201D; a will formed by &#x201C;radical democratic&#x201D; procedures, procedures which &#x201C;would put participants <span class="italic">themselves</span> in a position to realize concrete possibilities for a better and less threatened life, on <span class="italic">their own</span> initiative and in accordance with <span class="italic">their own</span> needs and insights&#x201D;.<a id="c02-nts11a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts11"><sup class="frac">11</sup></a></p><h2 class="B_HEAD">Notes</h2><div class="note_hang"><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart" id="c02-nts1"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts1a">1.</a> Here I pass over the fascist solution, which dresses up an authoritarian capitalist modernization as a social-communitary national-populism.</p><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart" id="c02-nts2"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts2a">2.</a> &#x201C;The New Obscurity&#x201D;, in <span class="italic">The New Conservatism</span>, Cambridge, MA 1989, pp. 58&#x2013;9.</p><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart" id="c02-nts3"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts3a">3.</a><a id="page26"/>ibid., p. 60.</p><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart" id="c02-nts4"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c02_r1Grigo4358rMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c02-nts4a">4.</a> Cf.
