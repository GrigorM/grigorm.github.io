So long as commodity production remained marginal and the great majority of needs were covered by domestic production and the village economy, the notion of &#x201C;work&#x201D; as such (of &#x201C;<span class="italic">Arbeit schlechthin</span>&#x201D;, as Marx put it) could not take hold. People &#x201C;produced&#x201D;, &#x201C;constructed&#x201D; and &#x201C;prepared&#x201D; things; they &#x201C;laboured&#x201D;, &#x201C;toiled&#x201D;, &#x201C;drudged&#x201D; and &#x201C;attended to&#x201D; a variety of specific &#x201C;occupations&#x201D; which had no common measure between them within the framework of the domestic community. And responsibility for the various <span class="italic">activities</span> was assumed by the husband, the wife, the children or the older members of the family according to an immutable <a id="ind129a"/>division of labour. These activities were gendered, to borrow <a id="ind286a"/>Ivan Illich&#x2019;s expression, and there was thus no common denominator between them.<a id="c06-nts1a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c06_r1Grigor4968Malogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c06-nts1"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a> They were not interchangeable, and could not be compared and evaluated in terms of a single yardstick.

Then &#x201C;work&#x201D; became the name of an activity fundamentally different from the activities of subsistence, reproduction, maintenance and care performed within the household. This is not so much because &#x201C;work&#x201D; is a paid activity, but because it is done in the public domain and appears there as a <span class="italic">measurable</span>, <span class="italic">exchangeable and interchangeable performance</span>; as a performance which possesses a use-value for others, not simply for the members of the household community carrying it out: <span class="italic">for others in general</span>, without distinction or restriction, not for a particular, private person.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">The modern notion of work thus originally refers to a performance <a id="page54"/><a id="ind717a"/>intended for others, possessing utility or use-value for them and hence entitling the person carrying it out to a certain reward or compensation from them.

The semantic difficulties one gets into when one seeks to extend the notion of work to all kinds of activities where human relations are to the fore can be appreciated rather clearly from the following passage (with which, in fact, I would entirely concur, were it not for the author&#x2019;s attempt to rescue the socialist ideology of work by a semantic sleight of hand):</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">Not liberation <span class="italic">from</span> work, but the liberation <span class="italic">of</span> work must be the urgent aim of socialism.

The point is that if one defines work as &#x201C;creative activity&#x201D;, then one immediately has the problem of knowing what name to give to work which is not a creative activity, such as the work of supermarket checkout staff, labourers, cleaners, and most of the employees in the service sector, whether public (e.g. postal sorting) or private (waiters or waitresses, data-input personnel).

The question, however, is to what extent this conception of work, handed down to us essentially by the <a id="ind561a"/>skilled industrial workers of <a id="page56"/>the nineteenth century (workers who were still close to <a id="ind19a"/>artisan production, and had a complete grasp of manufacturing <span class="italic">procedures</span> and the <span class="italic">products</span> to be made), can apply to the largely de-materialized, predetermined, specialized work which is the predominant form in today&#x2019;s macro-social space &#x2013; a form of activity which has no purchase or influence either on the way it is performed or on the final purpose it is to serve, and is commonly referred to simply as &#x201C;work&#x201D;.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">In continuing to apply the idea of work-as<span class="italic">-poiesis</span> to tasks which in industry, particularly in the <a id="ind555a"/>service sector, no longer have anything in common with the activities of material transformation and creation carried on by the toolmakers, boilermakers, metal-turners, masons and rolling-mill workers of the nineteenth century, one runs the risk of demanding that today&#x2019;s workers or employees regard as their &#x201C;means of personal fulfilment&#x201D; precisely those tasks which prevent such self-fulfilment. The <a id="ind284a"/>ideology of work, which argues that &#x201C;work is life&#x201D; and demands that it be taken seriously and treated as a vocation, and the attendant utopia of a society ruled by the associated producers, play right into the hands of the employers, consolidate capitalist relations of production and domination, and legitimate the privileges of a work elite which, despite the existence of millions of unemployed, views a <a id="ind736a"/>reduction in working hours which could create extra jobs as incompatible with its professional pride and ethic of productivity.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">If one understands the term &#x201C;work&#x201D; in the sense of &#x201C;<span class="italic">poiesis</span>&#x201D; or even, as <a id="ind428a"/>Oskar Negt does at times, in the sense of &#x201C;<span class="italic">praxis</span>&#x201D;, the term &#x201C;work&#x201D; should not be applied without clearly stated qualification to the immense majority of currently existing jobs and occupations.<a id="c06-nts8a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c06_r1Grigor4968Malogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c06-nts8"><sup class="frac">8</sup></a> If work is to be the equivalent of <span class="italic">poiesis</span>, then real, existing &#x201C;work&#x201D; &#x2013; which, even for highly skilled members of the workforce, is predetermined in its procedures and aims, specialized and de-materialized &#x2013; is not &#x201C;true&#x201D; but &#x201C;false&#x201D; work.<sup class="frac"><a class="hlink" id="c06-ftn1a" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c06_r1Grigor4968Malogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c06-ftn1">&#x002A;</a></sup></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">This is not merely a semantic dispute. For as long as a broad stratum of workers could understand their work as the activity by which the human individual realized his being, thanks to the power exerted over matter, it was inherent in the essence of work to seek to emancipate itself from any form of power exerted over the worker. The transformation of work &#x2013; of <span class="italic">all</span> work &#x2013; into an <a id="ind35a"/>autonomous activity was, according to Marx, the meaning of communism as a lived historical horizon: it was not a distant goal but the lived meaning of the workers&#x2019; struggles against exploitation, oppression and <a id="ind8a"/>alienation. Since reification, compulsion <a id="page57"/>and narrow specialization were negations of the essence of &#x201C;true&#x201D; work and the worker as subject, it was impossible for him not to experience his alienation, and not to aspire to free himself from it.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">The desire for the liberation of work, for its transformation into autonomous activity, was thus inherent in the essence of true work &#x2013; and in its alienation. Even when it was alienated, true work rendered the subjects performing it capable of autonomous activity. For them to be able to exercise that <span class="italic">capacity</span> effectively, only the political conditions which would have allowed them to free themselves from all domination were missing. The <span class="italic">possibility</span> of transforming work into autonomous activity seemed given; it simply required &#x2013; and this is a political condition &#x2013; that the collective appropriation of the means of production be achieved.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">In present conditions, by contrast, neither the material possibility nor the subjective capacity for a transformation of work into autonomous activity exists. The labour process and the nature of the tasks performed in work develop the capacity to engage in autonomous activities only in an ever smaller number of employees. That capacity is greater among workers whose origins are in pre-industrial countries (particularly among workers in the building sector and civil engineering) than among modern employees with a technical or multiskilled training. The studies by Horst <a id="ind332a"/>Kern and Michael <a id="ind540a"/>Schumann contain illuminating data on this question: technical skills and qualifications do not give rise to a qualified specialist <span class="italic">ability</span>; workers do not have capacities which they can &#x201C;objectify in specific performances&#x201D;.<a id="c06-nts9a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c06_r1Grigor4968Malogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c06-nts9"><sup class="frac">9</sup></a> This remark applies, <span class="italic">a fortiori</span>, to intellectual workers, computerized jobs and service personnel. Where individuals are still capable of &#x201C;sensuous-practical activities impressing their stamp on the material world&#x201D;, they have acquired this capacity, and exercise it, outside their gainful employment. &#x201C;Work&#x201D;, in the sense of self-realization by the creation of &#x201C;non-alienated objects&#x201D;, is most often an extracurricular occupation unrelated to the work at which individuals &#x201C;earn their living&#x201D;. In short, &#x201C;true work&#x201D; is precisely that work we do when we are not &#x201C;at work&#x201D;. Now, there is no social space in which &#x201C;true work&#x201D; &#x2013; which, depending upon the circumstances, I prefer to call &#x201C;work-for-oneself&#x201D; or &#x201C;autonomous activity&#x201D; &#x2013; can deploy itself in such a way as to <span class="italic">produce society</span> and set its stamp upon it.<a id="c06-nts10a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c06_r1Grigor4968Malogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c06-nts10"><sup class="frac">10</sup></a> <span class="italic">It is this space we have to create</span>. In this regard, a <a id="ind737a"/>reduction in working hours is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">This brings us to a whole set of politico-strategic questions. If one starts out from a &#x201C;philosophy of praxis&#x201D;, then there is, at first sight, every reason to hold that the prime goal of a Left trade-union and social politics must be the liberation of work or, in other words, <span class="italic">making possible</span> the transformation of waged work into autonomous activity. To that end <a id="page58"/>the nature and organization of work, the techniques and procedures, will have to be redefined so as to enable the workers fully to develop, <span class="italic">within</span> their work, their sensory, bodily and intellectual faculties. Liberation <span class="italic">in</span> work should therefore precede liberation <span class="italic">from</span> work &#x2013; its &#x201C;reduction to a minimum&#x201D;, as <a id="ind392a"/>Marx puts it &#x2013; for only a subject who has already developed his creative capacities will be capable, during his free time, of the autonomous activities on which the &#x201C;free development of [his] individuality depends&#x201D; (Marx). This is the argument developed by <a id="ind429a"/>Oskar Negt, among others:</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">If the cultural project is not an integral part of what remains determinant for the unity and meaning of a human life, i.e. material production&#x00A0;&#x2026;, then society will continue to become culturally impoverished, even if it drastically reduces the hours of compulsory work.<a id="c06-nts11a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c06_r1Grigor4968Malogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c06-nts11"><sup class="frac">11</sup></a></p></div><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">But the question immediately arises: <span class="italic">whose</span> cultural project is being spoken of here?

Now, not only is work in production largely de-materialized and detached from sensory experience, but only a declining minority still work in the sphere of material production.

In other words, the desire for liberation <span class="italic">in</span> work presupposes a practical experience of autonomy, but the workers are objectively and subjectively denied this by work which deforms and mutilates their sensuous-practical faculties. This was, at one remove, the thesis advanced by <a id="ind374a"/>Herbert Marcuse when he argued that in the affluent societies, the <a id="page59"/><a id="ind9a"/>alienation of individuals is so profound that they are not even able to be conscious of it.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">We shall not escape from this vicious circle until we cease to postulate dogmatically that work (real, existing work) is the essential factor of socialization and development of the human faculties &#x2013; in other words, that individuals are shaped (or determined) by their occupational roles to the point of neither being able, nor desiring, to develop other capacities.

This marks a fundamental difference from the conditions which prevailed in Marx&#x2019;s day. Today, education, training and socialization to a large extent precede the onset of working life, and are not &#x2013; and do not need to be &#x2013; linked to carrying on a particular trade or occupation.

It must be possible for work, its outcomes and aims, working conditions and relations, to be determined and negotiated by the workers themselves. But just as the functioning of complex social systems will never correspond to the intuitive perceptions of lived experience, so the work demanded by complex economic systems can never match up to the lived meaning of autonomous activities carried on for freely determined ends. The <a id="ind126a"/>division of labour on a macro-social &#x2013; if not, indeed, a continental or intercontinental &#x2013; scale always entails a vestige of irreducible <a id="ind10a"/>alienation and excessively narrow functional specialization. The technical complexity of most end-products, the diversity of technologies combined in them, practically exclude the manufacture from A to Z of complete end-products by self-organized work collectives, freely determining their mode of co-operation, pace and hours of work, production objectives and relations with the end-users. Communities can exert only partial control over processes integrated and co-ordinated at the level of the total social system; they can, at best, expand the space accorded to their influence and initiative; but they cannot eliminate the inertia and rigidities of the system (what Sartre termed the &#x201C;practicoinert&#x201D;) and its machinery. <a id="ind431a"/>Negt rightly points out that &#x201C;self-determination and collective control within the production process&#x201D; cannot prevent &#x201C;the ends, namely the production of goods and services, being <span class="italic">pre-given</span> and thus lying outside the decision-making power of individuals&#x201D;.<a id="c06-nts18a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c06_r1Grigor4968Malogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c06-nts18"><sup class="frac">18</sup></a></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart"><a id="ind726a"/>Workers&#x2019; control at the workplace may, to a large extent, &#x201C;humanize&#x201D; techniques and tasks, and establish self-managed, <span class="italic">&#x00E0; la carte</span> working hours, but it cannot effect a return to <a id="ind105a"/>craft production &#x2013; that is, to what Negt calls a &#x201C;world made out of our own objects, objects which we ourselves have produced&#x201D;.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">These remarks relating to the material and cultural evolution of work, <a id="page61"/>and of the values which underlie its critical evaluation, explain why I refuse to extend the notion of &#x201C;work&#x201D; to autonomous activities and <a id="ind723a"/>work-for-oneself (i.e. to work which has no use-value except for the person performing it). Reducing working hours will not have a liberating effect, and will not change society, if it merely serves to redistribute work and reduce unemployment. The reduction of working hours is not merely a means of managing the system, it is also an end in itself in so far as it reduces the systemic constraints and alienations which participation in the social process of production imposes on individuals and in so far as, on the other hand, it expands the space for self-determined activities, both individual and collective. This development of free activities which are no longer <span class="italic">work</span> (in the sense this term has come to assume) obviously cannot be produced simply by reducing working hours. It requires a <span class="italic">politics of time</span> which embraces the reshaping of the urban and natural environment, cultural politics, education and training, and reshapes the social services and public amenities in such a way as to create more scope for self-managed activities, mutual aid, voluntary co-operation and production for one&#x2019;s own use.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubpagerStart">I thus term &#x201C;work&#x201D; only such activities as have a place in the <span class="italic">social labour process</span> and are recognized as forming an integral part of it.

This is precisely what is recommended by the advocates of exogenesis (i.e. growing the foetus outside the mother&#x2019;s body right up to total maturation), on the pretext of &#x201C;releasing women from the servitude of motherhood&#x201D;. Women are to be spared the handicaps pregnancy and childbirth entail for their professional, sporting and social lives so that, in a society where productivity is the supreme value, they may be as &#x201C;highly efficient&#x201D; as men.

On this view, &#x201C;real&#x201D; work is auto-production for one&#x2019;s own subsistence, and the &#x201C;true&#x201D; economy is that in which individuals control their own means of production, in which the market does not become an alien force independent of individuals &#x2013; in which, in a word, exchange relations continue to be governed by the traditional, immutable norms of a communitary society.
