The question is not whether socialism &#x201C;in itself&#x201D; (whatever that might be) has a future, but whether, or in what form, conflicts, contradictions, needs and aspirations keep developing which require capitalism to be overcome and contain at least the seeds of non-capitalist concepts. What socialism can or should be will emerge from the way in which the developing conflicts and contradictions are experienced and interpreted. Socialism will never be achieved as the outcome of a &#x201C;scientific&#x201D; project; it will always be dependent on interpretations reflecting the self-understanding, subjectivity, lived cultural and political relationships of the actors.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">The concept of &#x201C;scientific socialism&#x201D; has lost all meaning. Within so-called &#x201C;real socialism&#x201D;, the supposed scientificity of its precepts had the practical function of dismissing people&#x2019;s needs, desires and protests as &#x201C;unscientific&#x201D; and &#x201C;subjective&#x201D;, and subordinating them to the systemic imperatives of the industrial apparatus which was to be established. &#x201C;Real socialist&#x201D; <a id="ind466a"/>planning conceived of society as a centrally directed industrial machinery, and required individuals to conform to that machinery&#x2019;s demands. Their life was to be completely rationalized &#x2013; that is, organized functionally by the <a id="ind50a"/>bureaucratic-industrial megamachine. Resistance to this functionalization, which in many respects resembled militarization, was condemned as petty-bourgeois or philistine <a id="ind297a"/>individualism.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">To the extent that it understood itself as a <span class="italic">system</span> which, in the name of the scientificity of its total rationalization, cut itself off from any <a id="page39"/>moorings in the lifeworld, and blocked individuals&#x2019; aspirations to emancipation and <a id="ind28a"/>autonomy, <a id="ind589a"/>socialism is dead. But socialism will continue to exist or revive again as a movement and historical horizon if, in keeping with its original meaning, it understands itself as striving to carry through the emancipation of individuals begun by the bourgeois revolution &#x2013; that is, to realize that emancipation also in areas in which, under <a id="ind55a"/>capitalism, individuals remain subordinated to systemic constraints, relations of dominance and alienation.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">2. Consequently, socialism can be understood only in relation to capitalism, of which it is the positive negation.<a id="c04-nts1a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c04_r1GrigorMalogri2078gormalogmailcom.htm#c04-nts1"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a> It has its origin in the ambiguity and incompleteness of capitalist modernization, in the intolerable effects of the free market economy. Everywhere it was introduced, the latter brought not only elements of radical emancipation but also new forms of exploitation and alienation. For the first time in history, individuals were freed from the despotism of the state or of princes, or from hierarchical dependency, and were granted the right to pursue their own material interests. As is well known, this right which was conceded to them unleashed the struggle &#x201C;of each against all&#x201D; in free <a id="ind384a"/>markets. Unrestricted <a id="ind95a"/>competition forced every business to use the factors of production as efficiently as possible &#x2013; that is, to seek to maximize productivity, innovation, profit and investment.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart"><a id="ind162a"/><a id="ind512a"/>Economic rationality was freed by the logic of the market from the religious, ethical, normative social precepts which, in earlier societies, had restricted its scope. Capitalism was and is the only form of society which makes competition, with the aim of maximizing productivity and profit, its first commandment, unremittingly striving to enrol society, education, labour, individual and collective consumption into the service of the greatest possible valorization of capital and, consequently, to extend the domination of economic rationality, which expresses itself unchecked in the logic of the market, to all areas of life and work.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">The socialist movement grew out of the struggle carried on by individuals united in solidarity to impose new social restrictions, based on ethical demands, on the sphere in which economic rationality can operate. Only such restrictions can guarantee the workers&#x2019; personal integrity and their right individually and collectively to self-determine how they live their lives. The import and purpose of the socialist movement has been &#x2013; and still is &#x2013; the emancipation of individuals in fields where the logic of market, competition and profit functions to prevent individuals from achieving autonomy and fulfilment.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart"><a id="page40"/>3. The history of capitalism contradicts the frequently heard assertion that there is no third way between the market economy and the defunct &#x201C;real socialist&#x201D; central state <a id="ind465a"/>planning. It is true, however, that industrialized <a id="ind171a"/><a id="ind513a"/>economic systems are and will remain capitalist, as long as the logic of the greatest possible return on the largest possible quantities of (fixed and circulating) capital determines working conditions, investment decisions, consumption and, consequently, the way of life, education and values. But it is obvious that even capitalist economic systems absolutely require the planning of both private and public investments (e.g. in the areas of research, development, education, training, infrastructure, energy and health policies) and the regulation and correction of the <a id="ind380a"/>markets&#x2019; workings through public <a id="ind244a"/>interventions, subsidies and taxes on production or consumption. Equally, they quite obviously need to keep the logic of the market and unrestrained <a id="ind96a"/>competition within limits laid down by social laws and institutions.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">The fact that these limitations on the scope of <a id="ind163a"/>economic rationality expressed through market laws are repeatedly attacked and denounced by the advocates of the free market economy demonstrates how central the conflict between, on the one hand, the economic rationality embodied in the logic of capital and, on the other, non-economic, individual and societal, needs and demands remains. The &#x201C;welfare&#x201D; state is a more or less humanized capitalism, not a democratic <a id="ind592a"/>socialism. Its social laws were stuck on top of capitalism &#x2013; or tacked on, as it were. What results from this process is not socialism, since social-state regulations create no sociability, no lived solidarity. They merely compensate for the decay, brought about by market and commodity relations, of grass-roots communities and of social cohesion anchored in the lifeworld, and thereby accelerate both that decay and an ever greater spread of commodity and cash relationships. The <a id="ind690a"/>welfare state becomes the guardian of the general interest against the &#x201C;every man for himself&#x201D; of market society, and also promotes the latter, in that it takes over and administers the general interest as an instance separated from civil society.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">It is possible to talk of socialism only when the bureaucratic-industrial system, its power apparatuses and technical constraints, are limited and restructured in such a way that the whole sphere of economically rational activities is enrolled in the service of forms of co-operation and exchange determined by social individuals themselves, and so retains only a subordinate significance.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">4. Socialism as horizon of meaning, as emancipatory utopia, must not be conceived of as a different economic and social <span class="italic">system</span>. Quite the <a id="page41"/>contrary: it is the conscious practical project of abolishing everything that makes society a system, a megamachine, together with the simultaneous expansion of autonomous self-regulated forms of sociability, which make possible &#x201C;the free development of individuality&#x201D;.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">In this respect there is no sharp distinction between the utopian contents of socialism and <a id="ind91a"/>communism. For us <span class="italic">today</span> they are distinct, because communism looks forward to the complete removal of commodity relations, of wage-labour and the social division of labour, of state administration and control &#x2013; as if &#x201C;system&#x201D; could be completely transferred to &#x201C;lifeworld&#x201D;, and even complex industrial societies could be self-governing like a kibbutz, or regress to self-sufficient communes. Whereas socialism, in my opinion, does not aim to abolish the economic and administrative systems, but only to limit and bind them into the lifeworld, so that a synergy with self-determined social and individual forms of living results.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">For socialists it is a question, to an increasing extent, of organizing society and sociability as spaces for individual emancipation and development, and of demonstrating the concrete possibility of such a reappropriation and self-organization of social life in their political, trade-union and cultural practice. Only through such solidaristic association and voluntary co-operation can individuals free themselves from their subordination to the uncontrolled logic of capital and market forces to become actors in the creation of a new society. To fight for socialism means concretely to claim the right of individuals to freedom, equality, physical integrity and self-determination, by acting so that the social conditions which conflict with this right are remodelled. Interestingly, <a id="ind344a"/>Rainer Land&#x2019;s noteworthy <span class="italic">Umbaupapier</span> (Reconstruction Paper) also tends in this same direction:</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">For me, socialism is a society which evolves in such a way as to create growing spaces for the development of individuals in the fields of material civilization, work, the environment and consumption.&#x2026;&#x00A0;A style of life and consumption which is rich but makes small demands on natural resources, which allows a great many varied subcultures to develop and expands the scope for individual autonomy &#x2013; these are the emerging values of a new conception of rationality. It will become a reality when all economic decision-makers develop their strategies and determine their decisions on the basis of the felt needs and lived interests of individuals themselves in their democratic organizations, associations and initiatives.<a id="c04-nts2a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c04_r1GrigorMalogri2078gormalogmailcom.htm#c04-nts2"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a></p></div><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">5. <a id="ind64a"/>Overcoming capitalism will come to be regarded as an urgent task when capitalism&#x2019;s systemic imperatives are seen as incompatible with the <a id="page42"/>preservation of life &#x2013; as threatening not only its foundations, but also the possibility of conferring meaning upon it.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">It no longer makes sense to expect the pressure of needs engendered by work to lead to a socialist transformation of society, or for such a transformation to be effected by the working class alone. The class antagonism between labour and capital still exists, but it now has superimposed upon it antagonisms which are not of the order of workplace struggles and relations of exploitation, and thus are not covered by traditional class analysis.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">It is not through identification with their work and their work role that modern wage-earners feel themselves justified in making demands for power which have the potential to change society. It is as citizens, residents, parents, teachers, students or as unemployed; it is their experience outside work that leads them to call capitalism into question. The radical critique of capitalism is not so much the result of the work experience itself as of the critical distance the workers take in respect of their work role; it is a result of the surplus individual capacities and social competencies which find no possibility of development within the work role; of the antagonism between <span class="italic">possible</span> quality of life, self-realization and autonomy on the one hand and the compulsion to maximize productivity and profit on the other. The competitive struggle between sectors of capital leads in every country to a reduction of social services, the reintroduction of night and weekend working, lack of job security, the marginalization of increasing sections of the population, the deterioration of the environment and quality of life &#x2013; in short, <span class="italic">to the surrender of the essential, so that the inessential can be produced as profitably and cheaply as possible</span>.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">Even more than their labour-power, the technical apparatuses of capital expropriate individuals&#x2019; lived relationships and their senses. It is only eco-socialist <a id="ind412a"/>modernization, not the ecological restructuring of industrial society, that can offer solutions, in this respect, which are neither technocratic nor authoritarian. A policy of free choice of working hours, expanded possibilities of self-determined activity and democratization of economic decision-making are the only paths which lead in freedom to a more frugal, ecologically sustainable consumer model based on self-restraint.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">The other path, that of an ecological modernization of capitalism, involves just as many dangers as the destruction of the natural bases of life &#x2013; which it threatens to continue in other ways. The reproduction of the &#x201C;natural&#x201D; bases of life can itself be industrialized and developed into a profitable eco-business, obeying the same imperatives of profitability as other consumer goods industries: in other words, satisfying basic needs not as well and as rationally as possible, but with the largest possible flow <a id="page43"/>of profitable commodities. An ecological techno-fascism would also be capable of reproducing the bases of life, by artificially replacing natural cycles, turning nature into business, as it were, and so industrializing the reproduction of life, even of human life, commodifying foetuses and organs and instrumentalizing genetic stock, including that of humans, in accordance with the demands of productivity and profit maximization. The trend is obvious: the unleashing of economic rationality, its offensive against ethical objections which attempt to set limits to it, is already under way.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">&#x201C;The redefinition of <a id="ind593a"/>socialism&#x201D;, writes the Viennese historian <a id="ind401a"/>Siegi Matti,</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart">can no longer proceed by the familiar pathways because capital is in the process of abrogating the &#x2018;social contract,&#x2019; of which bourgeois society, in Europe at least, has until now been so proud. For the first time in history, socialism really faces the prospect of having to embody everything that constitutes humanity &#x2013; solidarity, rebellion, the capacity for social and cultural creation and self-determination. These are not, however, by-products of capitalist development, but products of opposition and subversion.&#x2026;&#x00A0;What is at stake here is the revolutionary project in which people are something other than &#x2013; more than &#x2013; functionaries of a social machine; at stake is autonomy, the possibility that human beings may enter into truly free associations in which the domination of others &#x2013; whether it take the form of the Ten Commandments, state power or share ownership &#x2013; is no longer possible. If it is to survive, socialism will have to remember its origins of a hundred years ago. Those origins lay, to a greater extent than its present heirs are willing to admit, in an alliance of subversions.<a id="c04-nts3a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c04_r1GrigorMalogri2078gormalogmailcom.htm#c04-nts3"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a></p><p class="bl_right1 EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart"><span class="italic">Translated by Martin Chalmers and Chris Turner</span></p></div><h2 class="B_HEAD">Notes</h2><div class="note_hang"><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart" id="c04-nts1"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c04_r1GrigorMalogri2078gormalogmailcom.htm#c04-nts1a">1.</a> What <a id="ind426a"/>Oskar Negt has written with reference to China may be considered valid for all &#x201C;real socialist&#x201D; systems: &#x201C;So long as central problems of the democratic constitution of a society are not solved, the political moment of the bourgeois revolution remain the central theme&#x2019; <span class="italic">Modernisierung im Zeichen des Drachen</span>, Frankfurt-am-Main 1988.</p><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubPagerstart" id="c04-nts2"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c04_r1GrigorMalogri2078gormalogmailcom.htm#c04-nts2a">2.</a> Rainer Land and Michael Brie, <span class="italic">Das Umbaupapier</span>, Berlin 1990.
