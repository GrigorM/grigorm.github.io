The socialist movements, and later the socialist parties, developed out of the struggle against the exploitation and oppression of the wage-earning masses and the battle against the social goals and conceptions of the bourgeois ruling strata. The socialist project of a new society at first contained two elements.</p><div class="bull_hang"><p class="bull_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">&#x2022;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;On the one hand, there was the claim to leadership by a class of <a id="ind562a"/><a id="ind674a"/>skilled workers, which experienced its ability to control the production process itself in its daily practice. It was determined to seize power from the class of owners, whom it regarded as parasites and exploiters, in order to place the development of the productive forces at the service of emancipation and human needs.</p><p class="bull_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">&#x2022;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;On the other hand, there was the resistance of a disenfranchised and oppressed <a id="ind492a"/>proletariat of women, children and men who toiled in workshops and factories at starvation wages, and had to fight for their political and economic rights. These unskilled labouring masses could achieve the cultural and social perspectives with which <a id="page68"/><a id="ind491a"/>to overcome oppression only through an alliance with the skilled workers. Conversely, the potential leading class of skilled workers in part drew legitimation for its claim to leadership from the unbearable immiseration of the proletarian masses, for whom the elimination of capitalist domination was a question of life and death; however, legitimation was also provided by man&#x2019;s domination of the forces of nature, embodied in the worker &#x2013; above all in the versatile craft worker. The real subject of this domination was the worker himself, not only as &#x201C;collective worker&#x201D;, but also as individualized bearer of irreplaceable human capacities and human skills.</p></div><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">2. Beyond the historicity of the central conflict between <a id="ind339a"/>labour and capital, however, socialism signified more than its manifest political and social contents: more than emancipation of the disenfranchised, oppressed and exploited; more than just the claim to power of the immediate masters of nature. Resistance and the claim to power of the working class contained a fundamental <a id="ind56a"/>critique, not only of the capitalist relations of production, but also of capitalist rationality itself, as expressed in commodity, <a id="ind381a"/>market and competitive relationships.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Actions are economically rational in so far as they aim at the maximization of productivity. But this becomes possible only on two conditions: (1) Labour has to be separated from the personal singularity of the labourer and must be expressed as a calculable and measurable quantity; and (2) The economic goal of the maximization of productivity cannot be subordinated to any non-economic social, cultural or religious goals; it must be pursued ruthlessly. Only unlimited competition in a free market makes such ruthlessness possible &#x2013; indeed, enforces it. Only the &#x201C;free market economy&#x201D; permits economic rationality to make itself independent of the demands of sociality, in which it is embedded in all non-capitalist societies, and to withdraw from society&#x2019;s control &#x2013; in fact, even to enrol society in its service.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The socialist workers&#x2019; movement came into being as the positive negation of capitalist development. To the principle of the maximization of productivity, it counterposed the necessary self-limitation of the amount of labour performed by the workers; to the principle of competitive struggle between isolated individuals, it counterposed the principle of solidarity and mutual support, without which self-limitation would be practically impossible. The socialist workers&#x2019; movement aimed, therefore, to set limits to economic rationality, and ultimately to make that rationality serve the needs of a humane society.</p><h2 class="B_HEAD"><a id="page69"/>The Central Conflict</h2><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The central conflict out of which the socialist movement has developed revolves, then, around the expansion or limitation of the areas in which <a id="ind164a"/><a id="ind514a"/>economic rationality is allowed to evolve unhindered in market and commodity relations. It is characteristic of capitalist society that relations conducive to the valorization of capital predominate in the hierarchy of values, in everyday life and in politics. The socialist movement opposes this with the striving after a society in which the maximization of productivity and profit is locked into a total social framework in such a way that it is subordinated to non-quantifiable values and goals, and that economically rational labour no longer plays the principal role in the life of society or of the individual. Socialism, understood as the transcendence of economic rationality, assumes, consequently, that this rationality has already fully evolved. Where, in the absence of market and commodity relations, it has not yet established itself, &#x201C;socialism&#x201D; cannot set economic rationality in the service of a social project intended to transcend it. Where &#x201C;socialism&#x201D; is conceived as the planned development of as yet non-existent economic structures, it inevitably turns into its opposite: it subordinates society to the accumulation of capital, and posits economic rationality as the objective around which social life is to be reorganized. Such a society cannot assert its independence of economic rationality. It is &#x201C;economicized&#x201D; through and through.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">3. The central conflict over the extent and limits of economic rationality has lost nothing of its sharpness and historical significance. If one understands socialism as a form of society in which the demands deriving from this rationality are subordinated to social and cultural goals, then socialism remains more relevant than ever. Nevertheless, the concrete historical contents, as well as the actors in the central conflict, have changed. That conflict used to be conducted, culturally and politically, at the level of workplace struggles; it has gradually spread to other areas of social life. Other kinds of antagonism have been superimposed on the contradiction between living labour and capital, and have relativized it. The striving after emancipation, after fulfilment in activities freely chosen, and to shape one&#x2019;s own life cannot assert itself without trade-union struggles for a reshaping of work and conditions of work, but it also demands actions on other levels and on other fronts, which may be equally &#x2013; and at times even more &#x2013; important. The question as to the &#x201C;subject&#x201D; that will decide the central conflict, and in practice carry out the socialist transformation, cannot, consequently, be answered by means of traditional class analysis.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart"><a id="page70"/>4. In <a id="ind393a"/><a id="ind706a"/>Marxian analysis, the class of <a id="ind563a"/>skilled workers was destined to rule over a totality of productive forces, so that a totality of human capacities would develop in each worker. The fully developed individual would consequently resist every external determination, take command of the production process, and set himself the goal of the &#x201C;free development of individuality&#x201D; within and outside productive co-operation.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Now, unfortunately, actual developments have not confirmed these predictions. Although in parts of industry a &#x201C;recomposition of complex tasks&#x201D; (<a id="ind333a"/>Kern and <a id="ind541a"/>Schumann) is becoming possible or even necessary, there can be no question &#x2013; even in the case of the new, versatile, skilled production workers &#x2013; of a totality of skills being developed to command a totality of productive forces. The recomposed task always affects only the manufacture of parts of an end-product (for example, of crankshafts, cylinder heads, gearboxes) or of their assembly and control. As a consequence of its ever greater complexity, the total social production process demands a functional specialization of tasks in all areas. <a id="ind687a"/>Max Weber spoke in this context of <span class="italic">Fachmenschentum</span> (specialized mankind). But specialization always stands in contradiction to the free all-round development of individual capacities, even if it demands initiative, responsibility and personal commitment to the job. A computer specialist, a maintenance worker, a chemicals worker or a postman cannot feel themselves to be &#x2013; and develop themselves in their work as &#x2013; creative human beings, materially shaping with hand and mind the world experienced through their senses. They can succeed in doing so only outside their professional employment. Specialization &#x2013; that is, the social <a id="ind128a"/>division of labour beyond the level of the individual plant &#x2013; renders the production process opaque. In the course of their work the operatives can hardly have any influence on the decisions which relate to the character, determination, use-value and social utility of the end-products. A process worker is in no way different, according to <a id="ind433a"/>Oskar Negt, from the civil servant in a public body, who is also responsible only for sections of work cycles and for the precise execution of tasks that are placed before him. He makes a contribution to the functioning of areas about which, as a rule, he knows nothing.<a id="c07-nts3a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c07_r1GrigorMalogrigor4201malogmailcom.htm#c07-nts3"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The concept &#x2013; which first appears in <a id="ind275a"/>Hegel and is subsequently taken over by Marx &#x2013; according to which labour is the material shaping of the world experienced by the senses, through which man becomes the producer of himself, was still valid seventy years ago for the overwhelming majority of the working class: they were employed in non-formalized activities in which individual know-how, physical strength, planning and self-organization of the sequence of tasks played a decisive role. Today the majority of wage-earners work in administration, banks, shops or transport, in postal, caring and education services, where <a id="page71"/>individual performance is usually not measurable, and <a id="ind625a"/>labour has lost its materiality.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">There is no way that the &#x201C;modern workers&#x201D; who have now supplanted the old versatile skilled workers can question the meaning and social purpose of production on the basis of their intuitive understanding of their work or the power it confers on them. The transformation of the technical power exerted within the production process into political power within society can no longer be effected through the workers&#x2019; identification with their function. It requires, rather, that they distance themselves from the work role allotted to them, that they see that role within the context of the social system. A capacity to achieve such a perspective is at least potentially inherent in the socialization of these modern workers, since this does not primarily take the form of learning an occupational role. Indeed, professional training develops capacities which are never utilized to the full within labour. This may require a sense of responsibility and independence, but always only to fulfil predetermined functions: it demands &#x201C;autonomy within heteronomy&#x201D;.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">However, to have the <span class="italic">capacity</span> fundamentally to question capitalist relations of production is not the same as having the <span class="italic">possibility</span> of doing so. That possibility cannot be realized by the worker as such at the workplace (one thinks of maintenance specialists in automated plants, of employees in nuclear power stations or in the chemical industry), but only in their capacity as citizens, as consumers, as tenants, or as the users of private and public facilities &#x2013; that is, as participants in social relations beyond the workplace and members of a much larger community.</p><h2 class="B_HEAD">New Cultures of Resistance</h2><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">It can or should be the task of trade-union work to encourage this sense of a wider belonging, responsibility and solidarity, and the related distancing from a predetermined occupational role. However, this clearly implies a changed conception of <a id="ind646a"/>trade unionism. Its role would then no longer consist <span class="italic">solely</span> in representing and defending the interests of modern workers <span class="italic">as such</span>, but <span class="italic">also</span> in providing them with the possibility of seeing their occupational activity in relation to an economic and political development shaped by the valorization of capital. This can take many forms, such as working groups; public discussions and critical investigations regarding the social and political implications of technological innovations and their effect on the environment. &#x201C;What may be advantageous to the employees of one company,&#x201D; writes <a id="ind447a"/>Hinrich &#x00D6;tjen, &#x201C;may under certain circumstances involve disadvantages or reduced future opportunities for others&#x201D;, and he continues:</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart"><a id="page72"/>If the trade unions want to remain relevant, then at the very least a public debate on such conflicts of interest should be organized at a local level; otherwise new movements, which offer the workers the possibility of voicing their various interests, will be more relevant to them than the trade unions. Up to now, trade-union immobility has frequently given workers cause to set up citizens&#x2019; initiatives; they are discouraged by the difficulties they encounter when they try to organize such a debate within the trade union.<a id="c07-nts4a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c07_r1GrigorMalogrigor4201malogmailcom.htm#c07-nts4"><sup class="frac">4</sup></a></p></div><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The important point, then, is that for workers in the modern sectors, criticism of capitalism and a socialist sensibility are not to be derived from their working lives or their class consciousness but, rather, from the discovery they make as citizens, parents, consumers, residents of a neighbourhood or town, of capitalist development dispossessing them of their &#x2013; social and natural &#x2013; lifeworld. Thus it is neither their occupational capacities nor their identification with their jobs which will shape their resistance to that dispossession, but their lives and experience outside work.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">This is very much the argument advanced by <a id="ind635a"/>Alain Touraine.<a id="c07-nts5a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c07_r1GrigorMalogrigor4201malogmailcom.htm#c07-nts5"><sup class="frac">5</sup></a> According to him, the central conflict is no longer the antagonism between living labour and capital, but that between the large scientific-technical-bureaucratic apparatuses, which I &#x2013; following <a id="ind688a"/>Max Weber and <a id="ind421a"/>Lewis Mumford &#x2013; have called the &#x201C;bureaucratic&#x2013;industrial megamachine&#x201D;, and a population which feels itself robbed of the possibility of shaping its own life by external determination of its interests, by professional know-alls, and by technological appropriation of the environment. However, nothing should prevent one recognizing the <a id="ind51a"/>bureaucratic-industrial megamachine and its leading stratum as also the expression of an <a id="ind165a"/><a id="ind515a"/>economic rationality characteristic of capitalism, which takes the shape of industrial growth, the valorization of ever larger quantities of capital, the monetization and professionalization of social and interpersonal relations.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">5. The inadequacy of an analysis that relies principally on the cultural resistance to the &#x201C;colonization of the lifeworld&#x201D; contained in the &#x201C;new social movements&#x201D; is, in my view, that these movements do not consciously and concretely attack the domination of the economic rationality embodied in capitalism. These movements are certainly anti-technocratic &#x2013; that is, directed against the cultural hegemony of the leading stratum of the ruling class &#x2013; but they strike only at the cultural assumptions and social consequences of the relations of domination, not at their economic-material core. The new social movements will become the bearers of socialist transformation when they ally themselves not only <a id="page73"/><a id="ind309a"/>with the &#x201C;modern worker&#x201D; but also with the contemporary equivalent of the disenfranchised, oppressed and immiserated <a id="ind494a"/>proletariat &#x2013; that is, with the post-industrial proletariat of the unemployed, occasionally employed, short-term or part-time workers, who neither can nor want to identify themselves with their job or their place in the production process. Estimates that this group is likely to make up 50 per cent of the active population in the 1990s are beginning to seem realistic: in West <a id="ind221a"/>Germany, as in <a id="ind204a"/>France, more than half the workers newly started in recent years are employed in precarious or part-time jobs. Workers who are employed in this way already constitute in total more than a third of the wage-earning population. Together with the unemployed, that makes a &#x201C;post-industrial proletariat&#x201D; of 40 to 45 per cent in <a id="ind248a"/>Great Britain, and in the <a id="ind667a"/>United States as much as 45 to 50 per cent. The two-thirds society has already been left behind.<a id="c07-nts6a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c07_r1GrigorMalogrigor4201malogmailcom.htm#c07-nts6"><sup class="frac">6</sup></a></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Now it would be a mistake to see in the 40 per cent excluded from normal full-time <a id="ind754a"/>employment only people who hanker after a full-time job. In its most recent research related to the demand for a thirty-five-hour week, the Italian metal workers&#x2019; union, <a id="ind193a"/>Fiom-CGIL, reaches the same conclusion as similar studies in France and West Germany. According to this:</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">we are engaged in a process of social change as a result of which work now occupies only a minor place in people&#x2019;s lives. More precisely, work &#x2013; paid work &#x2013; is losing its central position, though it is more a <a id="ind282a"/>question of a decline of the socialization function of work than of a refusal to work. Work is valued only when it has the quality of autonomous creative activity. Otherwise it is regarded merely as a way of earning a living, and for women also as a way of achieving independence from the family.<a id="c07-nts7a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c07_r1GrigorMalogrigor4201malogmailcom.htm#c07-nts7"><sup class="frac">7</sup></a></p></div><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart"><a id="ind759a"/>Rainer Zoll also came to similar conclusions as a result of exhaustive research, with reference above all to young people. He concludes that &#x201C;the break-up of the old identity structures&#x201D; throws young people back on themselves &#x201C;in their search for an identity of their own&#x201D;. They could never achieve the permanent, stable identity that is produced by traditional <a id="ind106a"/>craft skills being handed down from father to son and mother to daughter; they have to build up an identity through &#x201C;communicational&#x201D; relations, and that identity, based on &#x201C;self-realization&#x201D;, will always be an open one, and subject to modification. The choice of professions potentially available to a young person is greater than ever, but the chances of actually finding what she or he was looking for &#x2013; namely a job with creative and socially useful aspects in which she or he could realize him- or herself &#x2013; is extremely limited. The number of such jobs is estimated at 5 per cent. It is therefore understandable that many have <a id="page74"/>already given up the race before it has even begun. The obvious consequence of this situation is that individuals transferred the search for self-realization to other terrains.<a id="c07-nts8a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c07_r1GrigorMalogrigor4201malogmailcom.htm#c07-nts8"><sup class="frac">8</sup></a> It should therefore be no surprise that, according to an Italian survey which now dates back quite a few years, young people frequently prefer to take part-time work, to enter precarious or short-term work situations, and to pursue if possible, by turns, a variety of activities; even among university students with limited means, the professional activity most frequently preferred was that which left most time for one&#x2019;s own cultural activities.<a id="c07-nts9a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c07_r1GrigorMalogrigor4201malogmailcom.htm#c07-nts9"><sup class="frac">9</sup></a> The impossibility of creating stable, socially useful, and <a id="ind516a"/>economically rational full-time jobs for almost half the wage-earning population is matched, therefore, by the desire among a significant proportion of younger wage-earners not to be tied, either full-time or for life, to a career or job which only very rarely makes use of all their personal capacities in a fulfilling way.</p><h2 class="B_HEAD">Limiting the Sphere of <a id="ind166a"/>Economic Rationality</h2><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Now what connects this post-industrial <a id="ind495a"/>proletariat of wage-earners who cannot identify themselves with their position in the productive process with the &#x201C;modern worker&#x201D;? Both strata experience the fragility of a wage relation based on measurable work performance. It is the case, both for those not working full-time or all the year round, or those who are precariously employed, and for the core workforces of &#x201C;modern workers&#x201D;, that their effective labour is not constantly required. The first group is needed for limited, usually short-term, foreseeable units of time; the second is needed for situations that are frequently quite unpredictable, which can occur several times a day or only relatively seldom. &#x201C;Process workers&#x201D;, maintenance specialists, and also firemen or caring professionals must be constantly available, and in an emergency also work twenty hours without a break. They are paid for their availability, not only for their performance. They are on duty even when they are not active. In the case of the precariously employed, by contrast, only that time is paid during which they are performing effective work, even though it is of the utmost importance to industry and services that flexible, willing and capable labour should be available at short notice. It is for exactly this reason that the demand of the precariously employed &#x2013; usually working less than six months a year &#x2013; that they also be paid for their availability during interruptions of the wage relation, which are no fault of theirs but advantageous to business, is quite legitimate.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">It is therefore a question of <a id="ind751a"/>uncoupling <a id="ind292a"/>income from work <span class="italic">time</span>, not income from work itself. This demand is altogether rational since, as a consequence of increases in <a id="ind484a"/>productivity through technical innovation, <a id="page75"/>the total economic production process requires less and less labour. Under these circumstances it is absurd to continue to make the wages paid out by the economy as a whole dependent on the volume of labour performed, and the individual income dependent on individually performed work time. Work time as the basis for the distribution of socially produced wealth is clung to solely for reasons of ideology and political domination. For the post-industrial <a id="ind496a"/>proletariat that is not employed full-time or all the year round, the wage relation becomes the manifest expression of a relation of domination whose previous legitimacy derived from the now untenable rationality of the work ethic. The common goal of the &#x201C;modern workers&#x201D; and the post-industrial proletariat is to free themselves from this domination. However, this goal is pursued by them in very different ways. For the post-industrial proletariat of <a id="ind375a"/>marginal workers, it is principally a matter of being able <span class="italic">to transform the frequent interruptions to their wage&#x2013;labour relationship into a new freedom</span>; that is, to be entitled to periodic unemployment instead of being condemned to it. For this purpose they need the right to a sufficient basic income which permits new lifestyles and forms of self-activity. For the core workforces of &#x201C;modern workers&#x201D;, as for others with full-time jobs, forms of control over working time, such as self-determined flexibility of working hours or even linear <a id="ind739a"/>reductions in the length of the working week, may seem more attractive.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">This may appear to be a new form of the earlier social stratification, with its distinction between <a id="ind564a"/>skilled workers on the one side and proletariat on the other. As in earlier times, the contemporary proletariat is rebelling principally against the arbitrariness of relations of domination that express themselves in the absurd compulsion to live from wage-labour of which not enough is available; while <a id="ind30a"/>autonomy within and outside professional life becomes the main desire of &#x201C;modern workers&#x201D;. The divisions between the two strata are consequently much more fluid than they may first appear to be, and could to a great extent be removed. Progressive general reductions in working hours must logically lead to a redistribution of work, whereby <span class="italic">the skilled jobs would be made available to a much larger number of wage-earners</span>; and at the same time <span class="italic">the right to &#x2013; and possibility of &#x2013; interruptions of the wage&#x2013;labour relation could be made available to everyone</span>. An alliance of both strata does indeed seem feasible, especially on the demand for reduced working hours, provided that such a demand does not become a straitjacket but enhances autonomy within and outside labour.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Reduction in the average annual working time, or even in the quantity of labour performed in the course of four or six years, entitling the wage-earner to an undiminished income, offers in this respect the greatest scope and possibilities of choice. The thirty-hour week, for example, <a id="page76"/>whose achievement the <a id="ind637a"/>trade unions and left-wing parties of most European countries have set themselves as a goal, corresponds to an annual working time of approximately 1,380 hours and, combined with the right to a sabbatical year, an average of approximately 1,150 hours annually. A society that no longer needs all its labour-power full-time and all the year round can also easily provide for reductions in working hours, without loss of income, in the form of the right to longer breaks from work. Until the beginning of the twentieth century, journeymen and <a id="ind565a"/>skilled workers always took this right. Variety, tramping, collecting experiences, were for them part of human dignity. Consequently, a reduction in working time must be regarded &#x201C;not only as a technocratic means to a more just distribution of work&#x201D; which allows everyone to acquire an indisputable right to their share of social wealth, &#x201C;but as the society-transforming goal of procuring more &#x2018;disposable time&#x2019; for human beings&#x201D;.<a id="c07-nts10a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c07_r1GrigorMalogrigor4201malogmailcom.htm#c07-nts10"><sup class="frac">10</sup></a> This time may be used however one likes, depending on one&#x2019;s situation in life, to experiment with other lifestyles or a second life outside work.

It has a chance only if it consciously insists on the creation of expanding free spaces for the development of a many-sided, communicative, everyday culture and everyday solidarity liberated from commodified relations of buying and selling.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">6. The expansion of areas freed from economic calculation and immanent economic necessities cannot mean that a socialist <span class="italic">economy</span> or alternative <span class="italic">economy</span> is taking the place of the capitalist one. There is no other science of management &#x2013; no other micro-economic rationality &#x2013; than the capitalist one. The question is solely to what extent the criteria of economic rationality should be subordinated to other types of rationality both within and beyond companies. Capitalist economic rationality aims at the greatest possible efficiency, which is measured by the &#x201C;surplus&#x201D; obtained per unit of circulating and fixed capital. Socialism <a id="page77"/>must be conceived as the binding of capitalist rationality within a democratically defined framework, which should serve the achievement of democratically determined goals, and also, of course, be reflected in the limitation of economic rationality within companies.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Consequently, there can be no question of dictating to public or private companies conditions which make the calculation of real costs and performance impossible, or which are incompatible with initiatives aiming at economic efficiency, and consequently prevent economically rational company management. If it is to have general validity &#x2013; which on the grounds of justice it must have &#x2013; reduction in working time cannot take place purely at the individual company level and be dependent on a particular company&#x2019;s increases in productivity. The compensation for wage reductions as a result of a general reduction in working hours, guaranteed to all, can also not be financed by a general taxation on increases in company productivity (machine tax), but must be guaranteed by indirect taxes, applicable to every European Community country, which are cost-neutral for the businesses and do not affect competitiveness. But that is already another chapter.</p><p class="right1 EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart"><span class="italic">Translated by Martin Chalmers and Chris Turner</span></p><h2 class="B_HEAD">Notes</h2><div class="note_hang"><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart" id="c07-nts1"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c07_r1GrigorMalogrigor4201malogmailcom.htm#c07-nts1a">1.</a> Detlev Claussen, &#x201C;Postmoderne Zeiten&#x201D;, in H.L.
