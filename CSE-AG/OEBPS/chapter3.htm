Written in June 1989 and published in the Party&#x2019;s theoretical journal alongside three other commentaries, it stresses the themes in the new programme which contrast with the traditional orientations of the European <a id="ind354a"/>Left.<a id="c03-nts1a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c03_r1GrigorMalo8744grigormalogmailcom.htm#c03-nts1"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a> Considering the disarray and lack of imagination which predominate in almost all the other great parties of the Left, the SPD&#x2019;s programme seems really innovative in several respects. Its analysis has provided an opportunity to clarify certain notions and themes (particularly the distinctions between capitalism and socialism, and between socially useful and reproductive labour)</span>.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart"><span class="italic">The question remains, however, to what extent the revamping of these themes and orientations is likely to renovate the inner life and outward image of an old Left party; or, in other terms, whether the renovators, who emerged from the struggles of the 1960s and 1970s, can really revamp the SPD by opening it up to the new social movements, cultural changes and the European transcendence of the nation-state. Can an old workers&#x2019; party assimilate new themes and new forms of action, and forge links with new movements, without losing its identity, cohesion, legitimacy and members? Can it reconcile its aspiration to wield power with the broadening of the field of political struggles, a more direct conception of democracy and a corresponding transformation of its own structures?</span></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart"><span class="italic">There seemed to be reason to doubt this after the Berlin congress of November 1989, when the Party programme was pushed into the background in favour of the theme of German unity. The renovation of an old party and the renewal of its ideological themes are never achieved without crises and some initial setbacks. The work of redefining old tasks by taking into account new realities can never be sure of success in the short term. The only sure thing is that the Left has no future if it does not buckle down to that undertaking. What <a id="ind680a"/>Antje Vollmer said of the <a id="ind253a"/>Greens goes for the whole of the Left: &#x201C;We have to perform the feat of responding to the questions both of the nineteenth and of the twenty-first centuries.&#x201D;</span></p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart"><a id="page28"/>1. Because it is the only major party of the <a id="ind355a"/>Left in Europe&#x2019;s economically most powerful country, the SPD is inevitably a reference point for the rest of the European Left. The problems it confronts are often those which the Left in the other countries will have to face in their turn when their economies reach a comparable level of development. In <a id="ind72a"/>Central and <a id="ind136a"/>Eastern Europe, too, the SPD&#x2019;s conception of what socialism can or ought to be in an overdeveloped democratic country is not without influence on the social and political forces which reject the alternative between state-bureaucratic dictatorship and the establishment of a market economy.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The SPD programme seems a pioneering initiative in three fields:</p><div class="bull_hang"><p class="bull_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">&#x2022;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;the ecological restructuring of <a id="ind299a"/>industrial society;</p><p class="bull_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">&#x2022;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;the <a id="ind732a"/>reduction of weekly working hours to thirty spread over five days, to which would also be added the right to a sabbatical year and additional (paid) holidays for the parents of young children and those in need of care &#x2013; i.e. an average annual working time of around a thousand hours;</p><p class="bull_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">&#x2022;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;the importance accorded to &#x201C;<a id="ind189a"/>feminine values&#x201D;, which are called upon to occupy a place in the lives of men as well as women that is at least equal to that of the &#x201C;<a id="ind400a"/>masculine values&#x201D; of efficiency and productivity. In short, <a id="ind279a"/>post-capitalist humanism and the end of the productivist society based on <a id="ind338a"/>labour as a commodity.</p></div><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Before analysing more closely what these themes imply for a renovated conception of socialism, I shall make a number of preliminary remarks.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">2. <span class="italic">Omissions</span>. The orientations and themes of the programme are most often presented axiomatically and normatively. As a result, some parts of it are strangely abstract. As an outside observer, I am quite pleased that the largest Left party in Europe should address itself to the universal consciousness in this way, rather than to determinate populations with determinate interests; I have a tendency to do the same myself &#x2013; a fact which, by the way, greatly limits my political tastes and understanding. But as an outside observer, I also doubt whether a programme conceived on these lines is capable both of securing the renewal of a great political party, whose identity has been forged by a long history, and of mobilizing the energies required to put that long-term programme into effect.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">At the risk of seeming old-fashioned, I would have liked the programme to explain to me how the past of a long-established workers&#x2019; party connects with &#x201C;the world in which we live&#x201D; and the orientations it proposes for the future. It should have explained where it came from, <a id="page29"/><a id="ind715a"/>what has changed since the previous long-term programme (<a id="ind38a"/>Bad Godesberg, 1959), where the dynamic at work in society &#x2013; and in international relations &#x2013; is leading, in what direction that dynamic can be reorientated to avoid the threats it harbours and fulfil the potential for liberation it contains. I should have liked to see something not only on the threat of destruction to the natural foundations of life, but also:</p><div class="bull_hang"><p class="bull_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">&#x2022;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;on the total collapse of entire societies and civilizations in the Americas, in Africa and in southern Asia;</p><p class="bull_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">&#x2022;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;on the crisis afflicting the notion of work and work itself which, in the great majority of jobs, no longer corresponds in any way to the concept forged by <a id="ind273a"/>Hegel and <a id="ind390a"/>Marx (work as the creative objectification of man&#x2019;s domination of matter);</p><p class="bull_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">&#x2022;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;on the extension of <a id="ind303a"/>industrialization to new fields of activity;</p><p class="bull_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">&#x2022;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;on the industrialization of <a id="ind112a"/>culture;</p><p class="bull_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">&#x2022;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;on the crisis of the idea of &#x201C;<a id="ind582a"/><a id="ind585a"/>socialism&#x201D;.</p></div><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Should the reference to socialism be abandoned (following the precedent of the <a id="ind453a"/>PCI in abandoning its reference to communism) or does it still have importance, not just in relation to the past but also as a means of specifying the potentialities for emancipation contained in the contradictions of current social and <a id="ind510a"/>economic processes?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">If it is to be retained, socialism will have to be redefined so as to show how its original meaning still has currency for us.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The programme may provide a useful starting point for such an endeavour. In its main themes, it does in fact propose reforms which imply going beyond capitalism to some extent. This is what I shall attempt to demonstrate in what follows.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">3. <span class="italic">Socialism</span>. The socialist movement made it its goal, from the very beginning, to impose limits on <a id="ind160a"/>economic rationality, as freely expressed in competitive market relations, and to subordinate this to the demands of a higher rationality. The struggle between those who sought to extend and those who sought to restrict the fields in which economic rationality could express itself in an unfettered manner has, from the outset, been the central conflict within capitalist societies. Those societies emerged as a result of the abolition of the (religious, cultural, aesthetic and social) restrictions to which economic rationality was subject in earlier societies.<a id="c03-nts2a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c03_r1GrigorMalo8744grigormalogmailcom.htm#c03-nts2"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a> Subsequently, capitalist societies were obliged, under the pressure of objective necessities but also of social struggles, to impose new and increasingly extensive limits on the play of economic rationality (e.g. the outlawing of slavery, of child labour, of the sale of wives; limiting the <a id="page30"/>working day; making Sunday a rest day; the minimum wage; health insurance; etc.).</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">From the socialist point of view, these limitations should impose a framework and a set of operating conditions on economic rationality which would subordinate it, in the end, to the aims of a society in which men and women would no longer be in any way in thrall to need or servitude. By contrast, in a capitalist perspective, it is society which has to be subordinated to the valorization of capital, the economic rationality of which is most surely guaranteed by the unfettered play of market laws.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">This central conflict has lost nothing of its acuteness and significance, though the social actors have changed considerably over the last hundred and sixty years.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Socialism may, therefore, be understood as the positive response to the disintegration of social bonds ensuing from the commodity and competitive relations characteristic of capitalism. That response is delivered chiefly by the dependent workers, or in their name. Where market and competitive relations (which also have a positive dimension) have never developed, &#x201C;socialism&#x201D;, for want of a social base, can only ever be an educative dictatorship with economic modernization as its goal. Such a dictatorship inevitably turns the socialism to which it pays lip service into its opposite: it subordinates society to the requirements of an economic apparatus that has yet to be constructed.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">What is at stake in the conflict between capitalism and socialism is not economic rationality as such, but the extent of the sphere in which economic rationality may exert its effects. An action is termed economically rational in so far as it tends to maximize the efficiency with which the factors of production are employed. Efficiency in the economic sense is measured by the profit realized per quantum of living or dead labour (circulating or fixed capital) employed. Whatever the property relations, there is no other economically rational way of managing an enterprise than the capitalist way. This is an obvious point which everyone now accepts. However, as to the extent to which the requirements of economic rationality will prevail over other types of rationality within the enterprise and the national economy, the capitalist and socialist responses will differ.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">A society remains capitalist so long as the relations shaped by economic rationality and functional to the valorization of capital are preponderant and mould the lives and activities of individuals, their scale of <a id="ind69a"/>values and culture. A society becomes socialist when the social relations shaped by the economic rationality of capital come to occupy only a subordinate place in relation to non-quantifiable values and goals, and, in consequence, in the life of society and in each person&#x2019;s life, <a id="page31"/>economically rational work is merely one activity among others of equal importance.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">4. <span class="italic"><a id="ind154a"/>Economic policy</span>. The conception I have just summarized is exemplified in certain passages of the programme, which imposes new and sometimes radical limitations on economic rationality. For example, one finds the following formulations in the chapter devoted to &#x201C;economic democracy&#x201D;: &#x201C;Societal goals are to take precedence over the demands of the valorization of private capital&#x201D;; &#x201C;the market must not determine the directions in which society develops. It must not decide in society&#x2019;s stead what technologies and what sectors of activity are to be developed&#x201D;; &#x201C;the state lays down the framework and conditions for economic development&#x201D; and &#x201C;must promote desirable developments&#x201D;; &#x201C;state and local plans lay down in advance objectives and orientations which enterprises must take into account in their decisions&#x201D;; the &#x201C;setting of the political framework and the co-ordination of enterprise and state plans&#x201D; is to &#x201C;make clear the general interest&#x201D;, and must &#x201C;be worked out with the participation of economic and social commissions&#x201D;. French-style planning, practically abandoned in the 1970s, seems called upon here to rise from the grave.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Given the central importance accorded to the <a id="ind733a"/>reduction of working hours in the programme, one might have expected that the chapter on economic policy would have indicated, if only briefly, that the reduction of working hours is not just an isolated measure, but an overall policy &#x2013; and one that also implies a policy on time, co-ordination of the plans of enterprises and administrative bodies, and the participation of the trade unions from the preparatory phase onwards. It might also have been pointed out that the cost of reducing working hours cannot simply be borne by each enterprise but demands public financing which neither causes price distortion nor blocks competition.<a id="c03-nts3a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c03_r1GrigorMalo8744grigormalogmailcom.htm#c03-nts3"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a> The lapidary statement &#x201C;we shall work out models of financing&#x201D; sounds almost comical: why did the SPD not set about this long ago?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Regarding the orientation and goals which the limitation of economic rationality is to subserve, the programme lays down two essential projects: <a id="ind144a"/>ecological restructuring and the extension of the spheres of activity and life that are to be freed from economic constraints.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">5. <span class="italic">Ecological restructuring</span>. The chapter devoted to ecological restructuring (or &#x201C;modernization&#x201D;) enumerates convincingly the sectors most urgently in need of transformation: &#x201C;The ecological restructuring of our <a id="ind175a"/>economy, from product design [products will have to be &#x2018;durable&#x2019; and <a id="page32"/><a id="ind420a"/><a id="ind502a"/><a id="ind734a"/>&#x2018;easy to repair&#x2019;] to the <a id="ind103a"/>consumption and <a id="ind522a"/>recycling of materials,&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;concerns all forms of <a id="ind483a"/>production and transformation of energy&#x201D;, and demands &#x201C;the ecological restructuring of the <a id="ind75a"/>chemical industry, transport and <a id="ind4a"/>agriculture&#x201D;. This latter is dealt with extensively and in detail.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The ecological reshaping of the industrial system relates particularly to heavy and capital-intensive industries. The chemical industry, for example, will have to undergo a substantial fall in its sales as a result of the move towards an agriculture &#x201C;which respects natural balances&#x201D;. This latter will spend only a fraction of what was spent by chemical agriculture on <a id="ind191a"/>fertilizers and <a id="ind461a"/>pest control. The development of urban and suburban <a id="ind497a"/>public transport, the priority granted to rail over road in the carrying of goods and passengers, speed limits, and the use of durable means of transport that are easy to repair and &#x201C;ecologically sound&#x201D; will lead to a fall in <a id="ind25a"/>automobile production. The development of public transport will not offer substitute outlets to industry on the same scale. Industry will neither be able, nor will it be required, to grow. &#x201C;Those activities must grow which secure the basic elements of life and improve its quality&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;[which] promote self-determination and autonomous creative activities. Those activities which threaten the natural foundations of life must diminish and disappear.&#x201D;</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">&#x201C;Technical innovation must not only serve ecological restructuring and rationalization&#x201D;, it must also &#x201C;raise the <a id="ind490a"/>productivity of labour, make possible shorter working hours&#x201D;, and &#x201C;free us from alienated labour&#x201D;. In short, the economic criteria of maximum productivity and profitability are subordinated to socio-ecological criteria.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Now, the economic imperative of productivity is totally different from the ecological imperative of resource conservation. <a id="ind140a"/>Ecological <a id="ind503a"/>rationality consists in satisfying material needs in the best way possible with as small a quantity as possible of goods with a high use-value and durability, and thus doing so with a minimum of work, capital and natural resources. The quest for maximum economic productivity, by contrast, consists in selling at as high a profit as possible the greatest possible quantity of goods produced with the maximum of efficiency, all of which demands a maximization of consumption and needs. Only by such a maximization is it possible to obtain a return on growing quantities of capital. As a consequence, the pursuit of maximum productivity at the enterprise level leads to increasing waste in the economy as a whole. But what appears, from the ecological point of view, as a waste and destruction of resources is perceived from the economic point of view as a source of growth: competition between enterprises speeds up innovation, and the volume of sales and velocity of capital circulation increase as a result of obsolescence and the more rapid renewal of products. And what, from the ecological point of view, seems a saving (product <a id="page33"/>durability, prevention of illness and accidents, lower energy and resource consumption) reduces the production of <a id="ind511a"/>economically measurable wealth in the form of <a id="ind234a"/>GNP, and appears on the macro-economic level as a source of loss.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The chapter devoted to &#x201C;economic democracy&#x201D; recognizes this contradiction between ecological and <a id="ind161a"/>economic rationality (&#x201C;an economy becomes ecologically and socially responsible only when democratic decisions take precedence over the pursuit of profit and economic power&#x201D;), but the chapter devoted to ecological restructuring attempts to argue that these two rationalities are one:</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">In the long term, what is ecologically unreasonable cannot be economically rational.&#x2026;&#x00A0;Ecological necessities have to become the basic principles of economic activity. If we set about ecological <a id="ind411a"/>modernization in time, we shall improve our chances of conquering tomorrow&#x2019;s markets and improve the competitiveness of our economy.</p></div><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">This last assertion alone has some truth in it. Those who are first to develop the economic production of solar energy, hydrogen motors and the storage of hydrogen, methods of biological pest control, and so on, may hope to win new outlets and obtain a return on substantial quantities of capital. But it would be an illusion to believe &#x2013; and paradoxical to hope &#x2013; that ecological rationalization can compensate for the decline and conversion of the classical industries by employing in an &#x201C;environmental economy&#x201D; the labour and capital that are saved elsewhere. For a great many enterprises, ecological conversion can be an engine of growth during the transitional period, but this cannot be the long-term goal from the macro-economic point of view. Industry and the economy as a whole cannot take the view that, thanks to ecological modernization, they will end up in a better condition; they must simply accept that without ecological modernization they will soon be in a much worse one. This is a policy for which there is no alternative, and one which must not be presented as an option motivated by the economic opportunities it affords. It has to be recognized that this policy runs counter to economic interests (the interests of capital) by emphasizing that it is quite simply impossible to continue as in the past, and that inactivity and indecision would have catastrophic consequences which would also make their impact on the economy.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Ecological rationalization can be summed up in the slogan &#x201C;less but better&#x201D;. Its aim is a society in which we live better while working and consuming less. Ecological modernization requires that investment no longer serve the growth of the economy but its contraction &#x2013; that is to say, it requires the sphere governed by economic rationality in the <a id="page34"/>modern sense to shrink. There can be no ecological modernization without restricting the dynamic of capitalist accumulation and reducing consumption by self-imposed restraint. The exigencies of ecological modernization coincide with those of a transformed <a id="ind440a"/>North-South relationship, and with the original aims of socialism.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The change in culture which this presupposes is precisely the one which is outlined in Chapter IV of the programme.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">6. <span class="italic"><a id="ind109a"/>Cultural change</span>. &#x201C;As the amount that has to be spent on basic needs diminishes, greater scope is created for education, culture, social interaction and meaningful <a id="ind364a"/>leisure. This is why we shall promote growth in these areas.&#x201D; The expansion in question here is obviously not of an <a id="ind721a"/>economic nature; it has nothing to do with the development of the culture industry, the leisure or <a id="ind456a"/>personal services industries which advocates of &#x201C;tertiarization&#x201D; expect to deliver a great number of jobs. There is a fundamental difference between economic activities and cultural activities. Economic rationality is a resolutely instrumental rationality: the means deployed are distinct from the objectives pursued, and these latter are themselves means of valorizing capital. But this kind of <a id="ind677a"/>utilitarian calculation is not applicable in cases where the objective of the activity is realized <span class="italic">in</span> (and not <span class="italic">by means of</span>) that activity itself, as is the situation in all caring activities in which the care taken of people, animals or objects, the care with which the various arts and faculties are cultivated, is of use for nothing <span class="italic">else</span>.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">This is why it is erroneous to refer to all activities as &#x201C;work&#x201D;, in order then to conclude that &#x201C;there is no shortage of work in our society&#x201D;. What is, in fact, in short supply is work for economic ends and purposes, work that can be socialized and monetized; by contrast, there is no lack of tasks which are not economically rational and rationalizable and which, for that reason, have never been granted consideration or developed as they deserve. These distinctions are already to be found in the work of <a id="ind572a"/>Adam Smith, who characterized as unproductive &#x2013; that is, lying outside economic rationality &#x2013; service [i.e. labour] &#x201C;which produces nothing for which an equal quantity of service can afterwards be procured&#x201D;. &#x201C;Unproductive labourers, and those who do not labour at all,&#x201D; he added, &#x201C;are all maintained by revenue&#x201D; &#x2013; that is, by an income paid out of surplus-value.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The many &#x201C;jobs left undone&#x201D; and the many &#x201C;needs left untended&#x201D; are neglected and unfinished precisely because they are not subject to economic criteria and cannot be evaluated in economic terms. As a consequence, they must be taken care of either by &#x201C;services financed out of public funds&#x201D; (i.e. by being paid out of surplus-value) or by people <a id="page35"/>themselves, individually or in mutual aid groups. It is absurd to desire, as the programme does, &#x201C;to accord the same value to all forms of socially necessary work&#x201D;, since not all activities in which people engage have the same value or conform to the same type of rationality, and some of them are not &#x2013; and must not be &#x2013; motivated by social necessity. We do not bring children into the world out of social necessity, nor do we raise them for that reason. The same applies to maintaining our houses and our bodies, and this indeed is why we do not accord society the right to prescribe, supervise or evaluate all these activities.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The social <a id="ind678a"/>utilitarianism of the following statement is particularly unacceptable: &#x201C;The state and society are dependent on the services rendered by family life-communities. <span class="italic">For this reason</span> [emphasis added], they have a right to expect to be protected and encouraged.&#x201D; This utilitarian approach is incompatible with a project which seeks to base itself on each person&#x2019;s right to determine the conduct of his or her life for him- or herself, and find fulfilment as an individual. Who ever entered a life-community <span class="italic">because</span> &#x201C;the state and society&#x201D; were &#x201C;dependent&#x201D; on their so doing? To be correct, the formulation would have to be reversed: &#x201C;Life-communities are indispensable to the fulfilment of the person. <span class="italic">For that reason</span>, the state and society must protect and encourage them in the name of the inalienable rights of the person.&#x201D;</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">A social project of the Left should start out from the fact that there are activities which deserve to be done on their own account &#x2013; activities on which the meaning and quality of life, and individual development and sovereignty, depend, but to which, as a result of the dominance of economic rationality, time and social recognition have never been granted. The point, then, is to act so that social time becomes available for these activities. And this will actually serve to reinforce the demand that paid and unpaid activities be fairly divided up between men and women.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">I find it particularly cheering that, for the first time (so far as I am aware) in history, the programme of a major political party stresses the importance of &#x201C;<a id="ind190a"/>feminine values&#x201D; such as &#x201C;sensitivity&#x201D; and &#x201C;imagination&#x201D;, &#x201C;love and conviviality, dreaming and thinking&#x201D;. &#x201C;Men, too, are becoming aware that the supposedly manly subordination of feeling and imagination to rationality and efficiency impoverishes them and even makes them ill. For society to become human, it has to cease to be manly.&#x201D; This could be <a id="ind373a"/>Herbert Marcuse, writing in 1969:</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The future demands of us, women and men, many qualities which were long regarded as feminine.&#x2026;&#x00A0;The education of young people must prepare them for this. It must assist in overcoming the division of the world into masculine and feminine worlds.</p><p class="bl_indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Like the ability to reason, sensitivity too requires education.</p><p class="bl_indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart"><a id="page36"/>Everyone, male and female, must have the opportunity to engage in activities which concern our locality or environment, and trade union or political life,&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;to be creative, to make music, write or engage in the fine arts, to do sport or busy ourselves in the garden or workshop. Local politics and the education system must see to it that the conditions for pursuing these activities are improved.</p><p class="bl_indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">We must introduce the six-hour day within the context of a five-day week in order that women and men can better combine their occupational activity, domestic and family tasks and voluntary and cultural activities.</p></div><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Furthermore, the programme makes provision for &#x201C;paid parental leave and paid leave to tend the sick&#x201D;. These, indeed, are measures which would put an end to the dominance of economic values, and open up the way to a socialist society.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The influence of the women&#x2019;s movement seems to have borne fruit here. As for the politico-cultural subjects who might put these orientations into practice, the programme offers the following observations, with which I entirely concur:</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">Civic initiatives and social movements modify the conception of the world and are, at the same time, an expression of changed consciousness. They ensure that important topics are debated; they enliven our democracy by creating new forms of political will-formation and they generally enrich our political culture. They can and, indeed, must pose ever renewed challenges to the political parties, but they can never replace them.</p><p class="bl_indent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">The political culture grows stale without the tension between future projects and the present reality. Future projects have a bearing only if millions of conscious citizens, male and female, see their hopes reflected in them. Only where people&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;can express their convictions and fears in the political sphere&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;can politics free itself from being a mere ratification of objective exigencies and carry through essential reforms.</p></div><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">These latter must be carried forward by an</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart">alliance of the old and new social movements. Collaboration with the trade unions remains the central axis of this alliance. But it must also include all those who, by their daily experience or their involvement in the new social movements, have become convinced of the need for fundamental reforms.</p><p class="bl_right1 EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart"><span class="italic">Mi va bene cos&#x00EC;</span>.</p></div><h2 class="B_HEAD"><a id="page37"/>Notes</h2><div class="note_hang"><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph EPubpagerstart" id="c03-nts1"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c03_r1GrigorMalo8744grigormalogmailcom.htm#c03-nts1a">1.</a> <span class="italic">Neue Gesellschaft/Frankfurter Hefte</span> (ed.
