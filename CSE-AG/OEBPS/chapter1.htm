The so-called &#x201C;real socialist&#x201D; systems have collapsed. The <a id="ind85a"/>Cold War is over. The West has won. Over whom? And over what? Is the West&#x2019;s victory a victory for democracy? A victory for capitalism? Can we now look confidently to the future and say that our social system has proved itself solid and durable; that it offers humanity the hope of a solution to its present and future problems; that it may serve as a model?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">Is not its &#x2013; relative and partial &#x2013; superiority related rather to its instability, its diversity, its capacity to develop, to transform itself, to put itself in question, which features relate, in their turn, to its multiple internal contradictions, its complex, multiform character, comparable to that of an ecosystem, which continually triggers new conflicts between partially autonomous forces that can neither be controlled nor placed once and for all in the service of a stable <span class="italic">order</span>?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">What is this complex society developing, changing and differentiating itself into? Is it moving towards thousands of partial markets that are increasingly less transparent, controllable or governable? Or is it going in the opposite direction, towards full social control of the forces and logic of the market? Or in both directions at once, in a process of whirls and eddies? Or in no discernible direction at all &#x2013; towards a meaningless disorder, a chaotic barbarism (like many giant North or South American cities)?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">Can a society perpetuate itself without direction or orientation, without any aim or hope. Can it perpetuate itself when the economic performance and efficiency which are its permanent obsession have as their supreme goal an excess of comfort? Will not a growing number of men and women be tempted, then, to seek a refuge from this absence of hope and orientation in abstractly religious &#x2013; if not, indeed, fundamentalist &#x2013; systems of thought?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart"><a id="page2"/><a id="ind217a"/>After the outbreak of the <a id="ind262a"/>Gulf War, the strongest wave of <a id="ind448a"/>neo-pacifism for ten years swept through Europe &#x2013; including, on this occasion, France. &#x201C;No blood for oil,&#x201D; &#x201C;Never again,&#x201D; &#x201C;Peace now,&#x201D; &#x201C;Immediate ceasefire,&#x201D; &#x201C;Not a penny for arms&#x201D; and &#x201C;US go home&#x201D; were some of the slogans &#x2013; together with, on a giant banner carried by Hamburg school students, &#x201C;<span class="italic">Wir haben Angst</span>&#x201D; [We are scared]. Scared of what, of whom, and since when? Scared of a bloody tyranny which, with the support of its SS and Gestapo, following the precise pattern of the Nazi state, had clothed its policy of forced modernization in a garb of racism, militarism and conquest? Scared of Europe&#x2019;s inability to come out from under the shadow of the United States to carry out, with its own (diplomatic, economic and military) means, a global policy of its own which might respond to the desire of the peoples of the South for emancipation? Scared of the ease with which the alternative Left, the Greens, the Communists and the extreme Right were able to join in a common front with the neo-pacifists to denounce American imperialism alone as the enemy of humanity, freedom and peaceful coexistence? Or scared that peace will be saved by making concessions and showing leniency to an army of torturers and plunderers? On the basis of what common values was it possible, then, for a front to be formed running from Chev&#x00E8;nement to Le Pen, from the alternative Left to the Club de l&#x2019;Horloge, from the Greens to the PCF, from the Fourth International to the historic Gaullists?</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">2. The West is victorious; there is no other economic system but capitalism. The poor people of Central and Eastern Europe have for decades longed for nothing else. They thought that with the collapse of &#x201C;real socialism&#x201D; they would enter the realm of freedom, prosperity, security and justice. They had rushed to vote for the Right, believing that the Right represented conservatism, security, individual well-being, and social and moral order based on traditional values. But they were wrong: the Right represents the market, competition, productivist imperatives, lust for profit and love of gain; it represents letting the weakest go to the wall, dismantling social security and the public services, <a id="ind655a"/>unemployment for a third &#x2013; and soon, perhaps, for half &#x2013; of the workforce of the former GDR, among others. They have, admittedly, been delivered from the totalitarian order, which is all well and good, and now they have freedom &#x2013; but &#x201C;freedom to do what?&#x201D;</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">Capitalism cannot abide a stable social order. This was already stated in the <span class="italic">Communist Manifesto</span>: &#x201C;All that is solid melts into air&#x201D;; whatever resists change will be pitilessly swept away. Security, stability and salvation can be only imaginary, mythical or religious. The void left by the <a id="page3"/><a id="ind500a"/><a id="ind661a"/>disappearance of the communitary social order rooted in tradition is filled by the nation, national sentiment and <a id="ind423a"/>nationalism. The &#x201C;identity&#x201D; which has disappeared with this order can exist now only in the form of a self-affirmation without substance, of a &#x201C;we are us&#x201D;: we are the Good, Evil comes from them; they are the ones to blame for the corruption of morals, the decadence of the nation, the disappearance of national&#x2013;communitary cohesion. Let us protect ourselves from them; let us fashion from our identity the walls of an impregnable fortress.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">In our part of the world, &#x201C;they&#x201D; are Turks, Pakistanis, Arabs, Jews, Jamaicans and Americans, whilst elsewhere &#x201C;they&#x201D; are Christians, Jews (again), Americans (again), Armenians and Kurds.&#x2026;&#x00A0;Forced <a id="ind413a"/>modernization has prompted a flight into pre-modern, <a id="ind524a"/>religious-nationalist ideologies and patterns of allegiance in Eastern Europe, in the Near and Middle East and in the South. But it is not only forced modernization that has done this. In the West, a modernization process begun three centuries ago &#x2013; now accelerating with computerization, digitalization, fashion, the market, rap music, Instant Food, Instant Sex, the dissolution of all social bonds, of all forms of security, all patterns of allegiance, community, solidarity and stability &#x2013; gives rise to the same escapist reactions.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">In the eyes of radicals of both Left and Right, one country, one people symbolize all the perversions and ills with which &#x201C;they&#x201D; have corrupted the world. That country, the embodiment of the hated foreigner, the satanic Other, is &#x201C;America&#x201D;, for America means &#x201C;melting-pot&#x201D;, the loss of ethnic identity, the mixing of races and cultures, hypermobility, the disintegration of the traditional order, the decadence of elites and the decline of the higher values, the domination of rootless capital and the power of money, individuals left to their own devices with no safety net of social protection. &#x201C;America&#x201D; is ourselves as Other.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">Nothing is closer to the nostalgic yearning of the religious fundamentalists and the extreme Right nationalists for an order which restores the unity of religion and life, work and morality, individual and national community, than the nostalgic aspiration on the extreme Left for a communitary society; nothing, in the eyes of both these groups, is more detestable than the emancipated individual, taking responsibility for his or her own life with a radically critical sense (whether Catholic or Protestant, Jewish or atheistic) of his or her autonomy. Ultimately, the enemy is, as ever, modernity &#x2013; that is, the emancipation of individuals from the immutable obligations and fixed place assigned to them by the hierarchical social order.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">I am not speaking here of the radical critique of American society and civilization, such as one finds in the work of <a id="ind372a"/>Herbert Marcuse; nor of the struggle against US imperialism. What I am concerned with are the <a id="page4"/>ideological presuppositions which, on both Right and Left, inflect that critique and that struggle towards a systematic denunciation on the basis of preconceived assumptions.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">3. In the East, with the collapse of (un)real <a id="ind584a"/>socialism, something else has also collapsed which has since been experienced there as a painful <a id="ind60a"/>lack: the degree of moral comfort which a life regulated by a <a id="ind606a"/>stable order &#x2013; albeit an oppressive one &#x2013; provides, together with the hope of seeing a different future, a future which, in another part of the world, was already a reality &#x2013; our reality. I am referring to the reality of Western societies, which stands revealed to those who gain access to it as cruelly bereft of orientation, of perspective, of an openness to goals which it might be meaningful to pursue. Deep down, fear of the future, withdrawal into the private sphere and despair are not products of the hole in the ozone layer or the greenhouse effect, nor even of the justified fear of the unforeseeable consequences of &#x2013; even a local &#x2013; war. They are caused, rather, by this society&#x2019;s lack of a perspective and a project, and by the impossibility of continuing much longer with its way of doing things, its way of life &#x2013; and not merely locally, but on a world scale. And they are caused by the collapse of social cohesion and lived social relations, the crisis of socialization, the fierce competition between job-hunters and, indeed, by all those things which render individuals impotent in the face of autonomized processes and faceless powers, and give rise to impotent protests and hatreds, to abstract glorifications of brute force, to nationalist-racist passions about identity or to finicky religiosities.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">The reasons for this impotence are clearly to be found in the incomprehensible and insuperable complexity of a social system whose autonomized production machinery and processes pose a threat to the natural foundations of individual existence. But in saying this (&#x201C;the system is wrong, it has to be torn up root and branch&#x201D;), one has said nothing &#x2013; at least, nothing of any political significance. For there is no different, transparently comprehensible, stable social system for which the real capitalist social system could be overthrown; nor does a historical subject exist that has the capacity to abolish it. The &#x201C;global alternative&#x201D; which <a id="ind90a"/>communism once seemed to offer had already ceased to be credible by the 1950s &#x2013; if, indeed, it ever had been.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">With the final collapse of the <a id="ind609a"/>Soviet system, however, it is not just a variety of socialism that has collapsed, a variety which &#x2013; as may be demonstrated theoretically &#x2013; could not be &#x201C;truly socialist&#x201D;. What has also collapsed is the conception of &#x201C;authentic&#x201D; socialism (or communism) defined by the founding fathers, which continues to express itself in various ways in the form of a quasi-religious <span class="italic">faith</span>: the faith that it <span class="italic">must</span> <a id="page5"/>be possible to get beyond this complex, opaque, differentiated, perpetually changing <a id="ind578a"/>social system to recover the security and integration of <a id="ind604a"/>pre-modern societies &#x2013; that is, societies in which <a id="ind7a"/>alienation (a term which, for the young Marx, refers to autonomized social forces turning, as inhuman powers, against individuals) is abolished; in which the unity of work and life, of society and community, of the individual and the collective, of culture and politics, of economy and morality, is re-established; in which the functional requirements of the system coincide with the aims of everyone, and the meaning of each person&#x2019;s life coincides with the meaning of History. In short, a society where state power, law, economic activity, the political sphere and culture would require neither distinct agencies nor institutions, since a just, stable, good order would have been instituted once and for all, with no possible further development: History would have reached its term, and the notions of progress and modernity would no longer have any meaning.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">As I have attempted to demonstrate elsewhere,<a id="c01-nts1a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c01_r1GrigorMalogrigormalogmailc4936om.htm#c01-nts1"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a> in the <a id="ind304a"/>Soviet case this unified, totally integrated society was to be built, in the form of the <a id="ind124a"/>dictatorship of the proletariat, by total industrialization, and was to enable the individual to recognize him- or herself in the collectivity, to identify with the &#x201C;collective productive worker&#x201D;, to feel at one with him. The undifferentiated unity of the social and the individual, of the economic, political, cultural and ethical spheres, as postulated by the system, openly came into contradiction, however &#x2013; as might have been foreseen &#x2013; with an industrialized economic apparatus which demanded differentiation, complexity, technical, geographical and professional specialization, the division of labour on a countrywide scale, exchanges between enterprises, and consideration of material needs and necessities in production decisions &#x2013; in short, with the mechanisms of co-ordination, adjustment and equalization which, in the capitalist system, operate by way of <a id="ind376a"/>markets and <a id="ind87a"/>commodity relations between enterprises.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">However, commodity relations and markets presuppose the <a id="ind172a"/>relative autonomy both of the economic subsystem and of the management of economic units, the differentiation of the system into distinct (administrative, judicial, economic, political, scientific, etc.) spheres, and regulatory mechanisms which function according to their own laws independently of political power. All this is incompatible with an undifferentiated macro-social subject into which individuals are required to merge themselves totally.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">The unity of communitary society, whether socialist or communist, presumes that the functioning of the social <span class="italic">system</span> can be controlled consciously and deliberately on the basis of the untrammelled, intuitive perceptions of lived experience and the needs or interests of all. In the <a id="page6"/>case of an <a id="ind116a"/>industrial system, this collective control was to be secured by <a id="ind196a"/>Five-Year Plans. These were to render comprehensible a social machinery which was otherwise opaque by virtue of its size and complexity; and they were to translate overall system-level objectives into goals which everyone could espouse. Now, as ought to have been expected, the planned control by which the system as a whole was to become intuitively comprehensible itself demanded an administrative apparatus of an incomprehensible complexity which could not be mastered by individuals. That apparatus acquired autonomy <span class="italic">vis-&#x00E0;-vis</span> society and even <span class="italic">vis-&#x00E0;-vis</span> the agencies of government, pitting its own specific inertia against both decisions from above and initiatives from below. The autonomy of the economic subsystem from the experience and life of individuals, which in capitalism takes the form of market laws, here assumed the form of an autocratic and oppressive <a id="ind467a"/>planning apparatus. This produced an alienation even more total than that of the market system, since, as it was not differentiated into spheres and institutions that could interact with <a id="ind173a"/>relative autonomy, the Soviet system did not permit politico-administrative decisions to be adapted to real economic conditions or to felt needs. The system was bereft of a developmental dynamic of its own; it was incapable of reproducing &#x2013; and hence unable to cope with &#x2013; the degree of complexity and rate of innovation of capitalist industrial societies. It possessed both the failings of an immobile, pre-modern society and the defects of industrial capitalism, without having the advantages of either.<a id="c01-nts2a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c01_r1GrigorMalogrigormalogmailc4936om.htm#c01-nts2"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a></p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">4. These remarks are intended to indicate that a unified communitary society of a pre-modern type is impossible in the conditions of an industrial economy, which is necessarily complex. &#x201C;Real&#x201D; socialism demonstrated the inevitable failure of endeavours to re-establish the unity of life and reason in these conditions. A unified communitary (communist) society could be established (or re-established) only by reducing the complexity of the social system, a move which presupposes the &#x201C;wholesale abolition&#x201D; of industrial techniques and functional specialization &#x2013; and of the subdivision of tasks and commodity exchanges they require &#x2013; in favour of a stable social order (a stable-state economy) employing means of production that can be mastered by small communities for their own subsistence production.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">This is precisely the &#x201C;de-industrial&#x201D; utopia of the most radical <a id="ind259a"/>Greens. It is an updating, in regressive form, of the project of communist society. And since there is no social or historical subject capable of bringing this utopia into being, the theory of the inevitable collapse of capitalism is reworked in an <a id="ind57a"/>ecological version (though one which is not wholly <a id="page7"/>without verisimilitude). In that version, capitalist civilization is moving inexorably towards catastrophic collapse. There is no longer any need for a revolutionary class to overthrow capitalism: it is digging its own grave, and that of industrial civilization in general. The pre-modern character of this eco-radical theory is to be found in the way that it envisages the birth of a post-industrial society not as the result of a <span class="italic">development</span> by which capitalism would transcend itself, but as a destruction due to external factors. The dialectical materialist faith in a meaning and direction of history gives way to quasi-religious faith in the goodness of Nature, and of a natural order which is to be re-established.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">There are thus more than incidental affinities between &#x201C;Green&#x201D; and <a id="ind525a"/>religious fundamentalism. Indeed, we cannot entirely rule out <a id="ind307a"/>Islamic fundamentalism resorting to biological or nuclear weapons in order to annihilate godless modern civilization with its own wicked technology. From the point of view of pre-modern fundamentalisms, the whole development of modernity, from its beginnings right up to our own day, has been a sin against the natural order of the world. Its catastrophic end will force humanity to make the necessary conversion. There is nothing to conserve, and nothing will remain. There is no rational path to salvation; only the inevitable collapse can open up the way.<a id="c01-nts3a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c01_r1GrigorMalogrigormalogmailc4936om.htm#c01-nts3"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a></p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">5. Yet it remains an open question whether there might not be a possible way forward, staking our hopes not on a return to the past but on the capacity of modern societies to transcend themselves and enter on a different mode of development from the one which has shaped them up to now. Is not this capacity for transcendence contained in the fundamental capacity for reform which modern social systems possess by virtue of the instability and mobility to which their complexity condemns them? Does not capitalism, which has hitherto been the only form of society capable of continual development and change, contain latent potentialities of liberatory <a id="ind67a"/>transformation? Is that society capable of evolving <span class="italic">because</span> it is capitalist, or can it perhaps transcend its capitalist form <span class="italic">because</span> it is capable, by virtue of its modern complexity, of evolving? Are not modernization and the differentiation of spheres of activity and institutions incomplete so long as one of these spheres subordinates the others to its <a id="ind306a"/><a id="ind521a"/>instrumental rationality &#x2013; so long, to use <a id="ind264a"/>Habermas&#x2019;s words, as &#x201C;capitalist development&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;promotes a pattern of rationalization such that cognitive-instrumental rationality penetrates beyond the economy and state into other spheres of life and there enjoys a preeminence at the expense of moral-practical and aesthetic-practical rationality?&#x201D;<a id="c01-nts4a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c01_r1GrigorMalogrigormalogmailc4936om.htm#c01-nts4"><sup class="frac">4</sup></a> Does not the development of modern society in the direction of ever greater differentiation demand that the domination of lived aspirations and <a id="page8"/><a id="ind728a"/>needs by <a id="ind155a"/><a id="ind505a"/>economic rationality &#x2013; that is, by the market, by exchange value, by the logic of capital &#x2013; now be abolished? How are we to describe the import of this development which would abolish capitalism to the extent that it would limit the scope of the criteria of profitability and thus the power of capital, and would orientate the economy and technology &#x2013; and hence the model of consumption &#x2013; not towards the maximization of profitability but towards an optimum quality of life? Does not such a reorientation, with all that it implies in terms of the extension of democratic powers, correspond to the original, primal meaning of &#x201C;socialism&#x201D;, a meaning which certainly should not be confused with its traditional historical <a id="ind598a"/>contents?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">Socialism is, without doubt, totally obsolete if it is reduced to its traditional contents: to the &#x201C;full development of the productive forces&#x201D;; to the collectivization (or socialization) of the means of production; to the appropriation and direct control of the means of production and exchange by the &#x201C;associated producers&#x201D;; to the planned management of the economic system conceived as a single large enterprise; to the abolition of wage-labour and commodity relations; to the suppression of the state and of the relative autonomy of the state administration, the judiciary, the press, art, the economy, the private sphere, and so on &#x2013; in short, if it is reduced to the restoration of the pre-modern, undifferentiated unity of the individual, community and functional spheres of paid work and self-determined activities; a restoration which, breaking radically with the complexity of modern social systems, is intended to have a stable order as its end product.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">If, on the other hand, the contents of the socialist projects of the past are viewed not in themselves but in their relationship with the conditions of the time, they still retain a clear meaning for us today. The objective was then, and &#x2013; as I shall attempt to demonstrate below &#x2013; still is today, to limit the field in which economic rationality may find expression &#x2013; or, in other words, to limit the logic of profit and the market. The point is to subject economic and technical development to a pattern and orientations which have been thought through and democratically debated; to tie in the goals of the economy with the free public expression of felt needs, instead of creating needs for the sole purpose of enabling capital to expand and commerce to develop. But the social actors pressing for such a development are no longer, first and foremost, the rapidly declining class of industrial workers, even though their occupational and class organizations must continue to exert a decisive influence on the development and outcome of social conflicts.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">6.

The answer cannot simply be to eliminate the autonomized economic and social forces (of the state, capital, money, the market, the legal system). For though that elimination makes it possible to impose directly political objectives upon development, it leads just as directly to &#x201C;the dead-end of the forms of bureaucratic-administrative society&#x201D;, which are just as incapable of adjusting their economic decisions to the needs and lifeworld interests of individuals.

They have been capable of employing or developing modern techniques only for unproductive purposes of prestige and power &#x2013; purposes entirely foreign to the lived interests and aspirations of civil society.

And, as <a id="ind342a"/>Land stresses, we must also not forget that &#x201C;the definition of the contents of development takes place only within the context of the effective process of innovation and selection&#x201D;, and that as a result, by seeking to predetermine these contents in the form of a pre-established plan, one &#x201C;actually consolidates the existing structures&#x201D; by &#x201C;excluding structural change and qualitative <a id="ind68a"/>transformations&#x201D;.<a id="c01-nts9a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c01_r1GrigorMalogrigormalogmailc4936om.htm#c01-nts9"><sup class="frac">9</sup></a> Only the general orientations of development &#x2013; its priorities and particular goals &#x2013; can be pre-established, and these may be contrary to strictly economic criteria (to the extent, for example, that they impose conditions on enterprises which increase their costs), but the precondition for these will always be an economy that is efficient enough for the potential surplus it produces to be redirected in large measure to non-economic ends.</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">This does not mean plans are superfluous.

The solution (and I shall return to this several times in what follows) consists in winning from the megamachine (or the &#x201C;system&#x201D;, as Habermas calls it) broader and broader spaces in which a &#x201C;logic of life&#x201D; can unfold freely, and in making the system compatible &#x2013; by <a id="page12"/>its orientations, its techniques, the limits of the space it occupies and the restrictions and rules to which its functioning is subject &#x2013; with that free unfolding of life.

That battle is never definitively won or lost. It continues, and it will continue.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">8. I shall confine myself for the moment to a brief and partial enumeration of the pressing objective issues which determine the present contents of that struggle.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">(i) The <a id="ind143a"/><a id="ind603a"/>ecological restructuring of society demands that <a id="ind156a"/><a id="ind506a"/>economic rationality be subordinated to an eco-social rationality. That subordination is incompatible with the capitalist paradigm of maximization of productivity and profit. It is also incompatible with a market economy which forces competing enterprises into constant product innovation and differentiation, into continually creating new desires and proposing satisfaction of those desires by raising consumption to as high a level as possible, into putting obstacles in the way of that self-limitation of needs which would be the effect of production for oneself and the &#x201C;free choice&#x201D; of working <a id="ind730a"/>hours.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">(ii) If the ecological restructuring of the economy is to be effected not by technocratic and authoritarian <span class="italic">dirigisme</span> but by the reconstitution of a lifeworld, the fall in the production of commodities and commodity services will have to be achieved by way of a self-limitation of needs experienced as a reconquest of autonomy &#x2013; that is, by way of a democratic reorientation of economic development, with a simultaneous reduction of working hours and an extension, assisted by the creation of collective or community facilities, of the scope for co-operative or associative &#x201C;own-use&#x201D; production. Policies conceived along these lines must imperatively be thought out and implemented on a European scale, on the scale of a &#x201C;European eco-social space&#x201D;. It is on this scale alone that commercial competition and commodity rationality can be subjected to restrictive rules. There can be no nationalist Left, nor any merely national perspective for socialism. &#x201C;Will there be a European Left?&#x201D; This is the question that has to be answered first, and it is confronted here by <a id="ind328a"/>Otto Kallscheuer in the Postface to the present work.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">(iii) &#x201C;Socialism&#x201D; should not be taken to mean merely subordinating <a id="page13"/>the economy to the needs and values of society. It also involves the creation, as an effect of ever shorter and increasingly flexible working hours, of a growing sphere of sharing within the community, of voluntary and self-organized co-operation, of increasingly extensive self-determined activities. It is only by adopting such a course that the <a id="ind731a"/>reduction in the amount of work required by the economic system will not simply lead to <a id="ind656a"/>unemployment and the disintegration and South-Africanization of societies.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">(iv) For such a policy of reduction in working hours to be able to redistribute both work performed for payment and the <a id="ind131a"/>domestic work of self-maintenance, caring and child-rearing, income levels will have to cease to depend on the evolution of working time and the actual number of hours worked. The fact that a growing proportion of the workforce is already employed on tasks in which the productivity of labour is not measurable and that, for an increasing part of the active population, there are no regular or full-time jobs makes such an uncoupling all the more obviously imperative. The <a id="ind294a"/>right to interrupt one&#x2019;s working life without loss of income, together with the right to &#x201C;freely choose one&#x2019;s working hours&#x201D; and to manage one&#x2019;s own hours of work, amount to emancipatory demands that are now achievable.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">The right to an income uncoupled from length of working time does not need to be justified by the alleged &#x201C;social utility&#x201D; of the activities accomplished in the private household sphere. The argument that so-called &#x201C;reproductive&#x201D; activities or work in the private (and, in particular, family) sphere have a usefulness for society which is at least the equal of work in production masks a concern to rescue the ideology of work and utilitarianism peculiar to industrial societies. That utilitarianism is losing its validity and basis as technical developments are increasing the volume of disposable time. The point is to understand how and in what specific ways everyone &#x2013; men and women &#x2013; can take advantage of this disposable time; and this question, which is that of the very meaning of existence, transcends all calculations and criteria of utility. This is so because the criterion of utility always asks: &#x201C;What purpose does it serve?&#x201D; For what purpose <span class="italic">external</span> to itself is an activity useful? Disposable time, by contrast, time liberated from necessary work, acquires its meaning only in those activities which have no other end than their own unfolding: they are the time of life, the very unfolding of life itself.</p><p class="right EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart"><span class="small">JANUARY</span> 1991</p><h2 class="B_HEAD"><a id="page14"/>Notes</h2><div class="note_hang"><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart" id="c01-nts1"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c01_r1GrigorMalogrigormalogmailc4936om.htm#c01-nts1a">1.</a> See A.
