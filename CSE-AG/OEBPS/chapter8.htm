In your view, <a id="ind335a"/>Keynes is dead: full employment will not be re-established by stimulating economic growth. Don&#x2019;t recent developments in both the <a id="ind668a"/>United States and Europe show this argument to be ill-founded?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> It all depends on what you mean by &#x201C;full employment&#x201D;. In the past, the term referred to a situation in which everyone could find a full-time job, lasting all year, from the time they left school until they retired. We shall never see that again. In all the industrially developed countries, between 40 and 50 per cent of the active population are in what is called &#x201C;atypical&#x201D; employment &#x2013; precarious, part-time, temporary, or short-term jobs with periods of unemployment in between. This is as true in <a id="ind696a"/>Western Europe as in the United States.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">The &#x201C;death of Keynes&#x201D; was announced as long ago as the early 1970s in a study by the German metalworkers&#x2019; union in Frankfurt, which showed that <a id="ind531a"/>robotization not only reduces the amount of labour required but also saves capital. In other words, the more you invest in industry, the more jobs you eliminate, and that includes jobs in the engineering industries. The &#x201C;<a id="ind485a"/>productivity of capital&#x201D; increases alongside the productivity of labour. <span class="italic">Fortune</span> magazine has published several studies of individual enterprises illustrating this fact, most notably one dated 25 <a id="page79"/>May 1987, on the <a id="ind318a"/>Japanese firm <a id="ind187a"/>Fanuc, where the manufacture of robots has itself been robotized. In one of its entirely automated plants, &#x201C;70 workers and 130 robots produce 18,000 motors a month. The plant cost &#x0024;32 million, which is around a tenth of what a conventional factory would have cost, and it requires only one-tenth as many workers.&#x201D;</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> Many economists would argue that you exaggerate the importance of productivity gains. They say these are happening much more slowly overall than in the 1960s, and the problem is not that they are too rapid but that they are insufficient.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> Statistically, that&#x2019;s right. But you have to see why. You have, roughly speaking, two sectors in modern economies. In the first of these, the <a id="ind402a"/>microelectronics revolution is bringing very rapid productivity gains. These are distinctly more rapid than in the past, in the order of 10 to 12 per cent per year in the automotive industry, for example. In the second sector, which covers services that cannot be industrialized (<a id="ind458a"/><a id="ind459a"/>personal services, teaching, advertising, decorating, etc.), productivity is progressing slowly or not at all. Now, as a direct result of increasing productivity, the number of workers in the first sector is constantly falling, whereas the number in the second sector is rising, because that is the only place where extra <a id="ind324a"/>jobs can be created, one way or another.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">Twenty years ago, workers in industry represented something like 40 per cent of the workforce in West <a id="ind222a"/>Germany, <a id="ind310a"/>Italy, and <a id="ind249a"/>Great Britain. When the productivity of labour increased by 7 per cent in industry and by 2 per cent in other activities, it grew by 4 per cent within the economy as a whole. Currently, workers in industry represent barely 30 per cent of the working population. Now, even if their productivity increased by nearly 10 per cent, the 4 per cent rise in overall annual productivity would be reached only if the productivity of services also rose, for its part, by 1.5 to 2 per cent. But such a rise is quite out of the question, because the main function of the very high &#x2013; and constantly growing &#x2013; proportion of services is to create jobs for people who would otherwise be unemployed, even if the jobs created are totally irrational from the economic point of view. That is what I have called the &#x201C;tertiary anti-economy&#x201D;, since its objective is to ensure that a maximum amount of paid labour is consumed, while the modern economy has the opposite goal, seeking to reduce the quantity of labour required per unit of production.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">If, for example, you take the jobs created in the last ten years or so in the <a id="ind669a"/>United States, you will find that most of these jobs have the following function: the two hours you used to spend mowing your lawn, walking your dog, going to fetch your paper, doing your housework, or looking after your children are transferred to a service-provider who does those <a id="page80"/>tasks in your stead, for payment. That person does nothing that you couldn&#x2019;t do yourself. He or she merely frees up two hours of your time by enabling you to buy two hours of his or her time. This type of transfer is the essential characteristic of servants&#x2019; work, and even the founding fathers of political economy insisted that work done by servants is economically unproductive. Moreover, this type of employment develops only in conditions of extreme inequality. The new servants offer their services to private individuals because they can&#x2019;t find jobs within the social process of production, and it&#x2019;s in the interest of private individuals to buy other people&#x2019;s time only if two hours of their own working time bring in distinctly more than they pay for two hours of the servants&#x2019; time. The &#x201C;<a id="ind601a"/>service society&#x201D;, based on the development of personal services, is necessarily a &#x201C;dual society&#x201D;.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> Yet <a id="ind436a"/>neo-liberals suggest that the technological revolution will have universally beneficial effects if only it is allowed to proceed unhindered. They defend policies designed to loosen <a id="ind382a"/>market rigidities and abolish state regulations on employees and investors. &#x201C;Be flexible or perish&#x201D; is the new motto, and we&#x2019;re now seeing an unprecedented cult of private enterprise bravely battling for its full market share.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> But the <a id="ind403a"/>microelectronics revolution wasn&#x2019;t launched by private enterprise. Its origins lie in the billions of dollars of public money invested by the American <a id="ind245a"/>government in its military and space programme. In <a id="ind319a"/>Japan, where it developed most quickly, that technological revolution was promoted voluntarily by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, working together with industry and the big banks. Microprocessors, biotechnologies, and nuclear and photovoltaic energy were all based initially on research and development financed by the state. In Europe, even industrial giants like Philips and Siemens agreed to take on the joint development of a 4-megabyte &#x201C;chip&#x201D; only on condition that they receive public funding for it.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">Neo-liberals always argue as if capital were invested spontaneously where unsatisfied needs are at their greatest. This has never been the case. Capital is invested where it can be sure of the highest returns. Producing to meet the most pressing needs of the needier sections of the population is never the best way to make the most money. The way to do that is to produce goods or services likely to appeal to the most prosperous strata. That is why the liberalization of the economy always begins by impoverishing the poor and enriching the rich. This was obvious in the last century and it is again today, not only in Bush&#x2019;s America or Thatcher&#x2019;s Britain, but also throughout the rest of Europe. If you examine the sectors in which exacerbated competition between enterprises is speeding up technical innovation, improving product <a id="page81"/><a id="ind15a"/>quality, and increasing productivity, you mainly find products aimed at the most prosperous segment of the population, while the standard of living of the people at the bottom of the wage ladder is continually deteriorating, as are their living conditions.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">The free play of market mechanisms leads, then, to <a id="ind574a"/>social decline, and contrary to what many neo-liberals argue, that social decline is not accompanied by economic boom. In fact, the opposite is true. The three European countries that have the most efficient economies and the highest technical standards &#x2013; <a id="ind616a"/>Sweden, <a id="ind620a"/>Switzerland, and West <a id="ind223a"/>Germany &#x2013; are precisely the ones where strong <a id="ind638a"/>trade-union power makes the labour market more rigid, hinders price competition, and maintains higher wages and better working conditions than elsewhere. Taking everything into account, <a id="ind681a"/>wage costs are 30 per cent higher there than in <a id="ind205a"/>France and 50 per cent higher than in <a id="ind250a"/>Britain. And that is why the productivity of labour and the rate of innovation are highest there. It is much more difficult in these countries &#x2013; particularly in Sweden &#x2013; to hire and fire temporary workers, so Swedish companies are forced to make unparalleled efforts to train their workforces and reorientate their production. The result is that the Swedish economy is probably the most flexible and efficient in the world. Where it is relatively easy to take on and lay off temporary workers and to employ a very low-cost workforce, as in Britain or France, technical innovation is less rapid and product quality lower.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> In all the countries of Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals, virtually everyone today is in favour of the unhindered play of market mechanisms. Yet in your writings you argue for an increasing restriction of the sphere of commodity exchange. You are one of the few still to claim a central role for <a id="ind463a"/>planning and for public control of macro-economic decisions. But aren&#x2019;t market mechanisms, contrary to what <a id="ind394a"/>Marx thought, something more than &#x2013; and other than &#x2013; characteristics of &#x201C;bourgeois&#x201D; society? Aren&#x2019;t they necessary to some extent, if only to prevent shortages and bottlenecks? And doesn&#x2019;t the idea of abolishing <a id="ind88a"/>commodity relations to make room for the self-management of production and exchange bear the imprint of last century&#x2019;s egalitarian utopias, which simply cannot be translated into reality?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> You are quite right that there can be no complex society without commodity relations or markets. The total abolition of market relations would presuppose the abolition of the social division and specialization of labour, and thus the return to autarkic <a id="ind92a"/>communities or a society of kibbutzim. <a id="ind346a"/>Ursula Le Guin conjured up a planetary kibbutz of this kind in her novel <span class="italic">The Dispossessed</span>, which is the most striking description I know of the seductions &#x2013; and snares &#x2013; of self-managed communist or, in other words, anarchist society.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><a id="page82"/>But we have to be clear first of all about what the terms &#x201C;commodity relations&#x201D;, &#x201C;<a id="ind5a"/>free competition&#x201D;, and &#x201C;market economy&#x201D; mean. &#x201C;Commodity relations&#x201D; means exchanges based on buying and selling in which what is being bought or sold takes the commodity form. You sell to me, I pay you, we are quits, and our relationship can end there. I have shown elsewhere that this buying and selling relationship is rational and functional only when the output of the object or service being sold is measurable, and where it therefore lends itself to quantitative evaluation. If it includes personal involvement, a &#x201C;gift of oneself&#x201D;, it is no longer possible to be quits by paying for it, whatever the price paid. It impoverishes and depersonalizes the fabric of emotional life and human relationships if commodity relations and monetarization are extended to the furnishing of non-quantifiable goods and services, which achieve their purpose only if money is not their goal. The more we extend the sphere of activities about which we can say &#x201C;This is not for sale&#x201D; or &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t put a price on this&#x201D;, the richer are our individual and social lives.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">Yet the existence of commodity relations does not necessarily imply the existence of a real market. Goods can be bought and sold at prices set by convention, in conformity with centuries-old tradition, or at prices fixed by the state. In this latter case, competing sellers do not directly confront buyers seeking to buy at the best price. The sellers are not, therefore, forced by competition to seek maximum productivity of the factors of production. This has advantages as well as disadvantages, as Max Weber and <a id="ind468a"/>Karl Polanyi &#x2013; not to mention Plato and the Christian theologians &#x2013; have shown.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">Lastly, there may be commodity relations and competition on <a id="ind383a"/>markets without there being a true market economy. And indeed, you made the distinction yourself in speaking of &#x201C;market mechanisms&#x201D; without using the term &#x201C;market economy&#x201D;. The fact is that the market economy is an economy in which prices are established freely, in every sector, at a level where supply and demand reach equilibrium, without <a id="ind246a"/>intervention or manipulation or hindrance of any kind. Do you know a single country whose economy is regulated in that way?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> The answer is certainly no, except for the land of pure capitalism that exists in the heads of certain <a id="ind437a"/>neo-liberals.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> If the price of agricultural produce or the level of wages were determined by the laws of supply and demand, most of us would long ago have died of starvation. In all the industrial nations, the relative prices of goods and services are regulated by the state; if they weren&#x2019;t, society wouldn&#x2019;t be viable. Everything that&#x2019;s vital is subsidized: agricultural production, housing, health, transport, education, libraries, research, museums, theatres, and so on. And the rest is taxed to varying degrees <a id="page83"/>by a system of VAT or specific taxes &#x2013; on petroleum products, alcohol, tobacco and matches, and so on. The more extensive the sphere of <a id="ind89a"/>commodity relations, the more the state has to intervene in the <a id="ind377a"/>market mechanisms to correct and regulate their functioning. The fact is that the market is, by definition, the outcome of the activities of individuals each pursuing his or her own immediate interests. Thus a higher authority, the state, is required to take responsibility for defending the general interest, including the existence of a market system.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> This brings us to the fundamental question: To what extent must market mechanisms be allowed free play?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> This is the question that has been at the heart of political conflict for two hundred years. Commodity relations, by which I mean the freedom of each individual to pursue his or her own immediate interests, tend to destroy both <a id="ind83a"/>civil society and the general conditions that make them possible. The nature and extent of the advantages that an individual has the right to procure for him- or herself must therefore be restricted by law. The history of capitalism is the history of a continual extension of these legal restrictions: the abolition of slavery; anti-monopoly and anti-trust legislation; the prohibition of the sale of children and women; the prohibition of child labour; Sunday as a rest day; the ten-hour and then the eight-hour working day; the legal minimum wage; legal standards for quality, safety, hygiene and pollution; universal health insurance; old age pensions; and so on.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">The basic problem is that this way of limiting and correcting market mechanisms does not prevent the destruction of civil society. The welfare state can, to a certain extent, limit the scope of that destruction, but overall it functions as a substitute for a civil society that is in the process of withering away. In some respects, it even hastens the process of decay. I&#x2019;m entirely in agreement with the way you treat this question in <span class="italic"><a id="ind123a"/>Democracy and Civil Society</span>: there can&#x2019;t be <a id="ind590a"/>socialism without democracy, and there can&#x2019;t be democracy without a much more substantial civil society comprising a set of self-organized public activities recognized and protected by the state. Socialism was born out of a conflict between civil society and the market. It took off as a movement by demanding that market forces be contained, subdued and controlled by society, whereas capitalism presented the opposite demand. However, for society to control market forces and place <a id="ind167a"/><a id="ind517a"/>economic rationality in the service of societal and cultural ends, it is necessary, first, that society have an autonomous existence; and second, that the market exist or has existed, and that economic agents have been coerced by it into economically rational behaviour &#x2013; that is, the pursuit of maximum efficiency in putting the factors of production to work.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><a id="page84"/>For us, in the capitalist countries, the first point is the most important. It implies that a socialist politics cannot be content merely to correct and regulate the operation of the market through state controls and services financed by the state. It must promote the development of a sphere of lived sociality (what the Germans call <span class="italic">soziale Lebenswelt</span>) made up of forms of self-organized, voluntary co-operation and of non-commodity, nonmonetary exchange. It must promote the social control of markets by citizens working together, and not merely by the public authorities. The question of what must be produced and how, the question of social priorities, of models of consumption, of styles of life &#x2013; all this is currently decided by technocrats, businessmen and bankers. Socialism would have to mean the democratization of these decisions, their public discussion at the level of associations, trade unions, movements, public hearings, and elected assemblies; and it would also have to mean taking into account criteria with which technocrats and company directors do not normally concern themselves.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> When you call for social forms of control of markets, that implies you&#x2019;ve given up the idea of a planned public sector, which you advocated in the past, at least for the production of necessities.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> In the 1960s, <a id="ind464a"/>planning was all the fashion. Today all forms of planning and public ownership are condemned, both in the East and in the West. Currently the &#x201C;market&#x201D; is in vogue, and is supposed to provide the necessary regulation and adjustments in an ideal way. This doesn&#x2019;t hold water. A complex economy cannot do without certain forms of planning. And planning is not incompatible either with the existence of markets or with the most varied forms of ownership, whether these be public, private, co-operative or municipal.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">If you rely solely on private initiative, on the market, you get into blind alleys. In China, for example, thousands of entrepreneurs all over the place set about manufacturing refrigerators, which is relatively easy and very profitable in the short run, only to find that the steel industry didn&#x2019;t produce enough sheet metal, since you can&#x2019;t set up the plants for producing that overnight; it requires long-term investment and infrastructures that depend on public funding. No industry, no large- or medium-scale enterprise, can dispense with planning its amortization, its investments, its labour needs, its purchases of raw materials and components several years ahead, and co-ordinating its plans with industries further up the line, and with the public authorities. And the same obviously goes for public services such as education, transport, insurance, roads, and water distribution. Or for agricultural production, in which the <a id="ind3a"/>free operation of the market and individual initiative lead, as in the four-year pig cycle, to overproduction with a collapse of prices, <a id="page85"/>followed by shortages and skyrocketing prices, and so on. These cyclical fluctuations, which bankrupt an increasing proportion of producers, can be avoided only if the producers organize into associations and set targets that are not to be exceeded for each type of produce. This is called the organization of markets and is, in fact, an example of corporatist self-organization.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">I cannot see why a complex society should not seek to co-ordinate all these sectoral plans, both private and public, and to define medium- and long-term priorities, orientations and goals for the whole of the economy. What I am talking about, in short, is a &#x201C;framework plan&#x201D;. In reality, the question is not whether there should be planning or not, but who plans and in whose interest they plan.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">The economic failure of the countries of <a id="ind73a"/>Central and <a id="ind137a"/>Eastern Europe was due not to the principle of planning but to the conditions and the methods employed. These prevented enterprises not only from competing but from even knowing what their costs were, and were thus an obstacle to the adoption of economically rational behaviour. Moreover, instead of reining in the operation of the economy to make it serve society, they forced society to serve the creation of an economic apparatus. The result was a non-society and a non-economy &#x2013; the very opposite of socialism.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">Yet the point is that it is quite possible to plan and socially control the adjustment of supply and demand without suppressing either competition between enterprises or the knowledge of costs.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> The emphasis you place on the <a id="ind740a"/>reduction of working hours may seem surprising when we look more closely at the transformations that technological changes have brought about in working conditions and labour relations. Weren&#x2019;t the allergic reaction to work and the refusal of work, which were very widespread in the early 1970s, due to the repetitive character of jobs in the Taylorized factory or office? Isn&#x2019;t capitalist production increasingly using what <a id="ind535a"/>Sabel and <a id="ind462a"/>Piore call &#x201C;flexible specialization&#x201D; in highly computerised production units in which the old <a id="ind546a"/>semi-<a id="ind566a"/>skilled workers have given way to teams of multiskilled operators who are highly trained, enjoy a great degree of autonomy, and are more like craft workers than old-style semi-skilled workers? Don&#x2019;t you underestimate the reskilling of workers, the rebirth of genuine craft work as a result of computerization?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> There have always been two tendencies within the labour movement: the glorification of work and the aspiration to work less. Those who glorified work were, for the most part, skilled workers who wielded great technical power within the factories. It seemed to them that it ought to be possible to transform that power into political power: they <a id="page86"/>thought the workers should collectively appropriate the means of production, become the dominant class, and make the economy function for the benefit of all. The glorification of labour was therefore also a way of highlighting the strength of the working class. The more the workers identified with their role in production, the more they cast doubt on the solidity and legitimacy of the bourgeoisie&#x2019;s power. Their work was the source of all wealth; the economy was based on industries and crafts with workers as numerous as soldiers in a great army: miners, steelworkers, boilermakers, navvies, and so on.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">But all that has completely changed. Identification with work and the glorification of work can no longer have the sense of an identification with the working class and a glorification of its might. This is a fact that certain sociologists &#x2013; particularly sociologists of <a id="ind298a"/>industrial labour relations &#x2013; will not see. Whether consciously or not, they want to preserve within their analyses the idea of a working class that derives from its technical power an aspiration to exercise political power and take control of the means of production.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">We must first of all situate the new multiskilled professional workers, who are autonomous in their work, in their context: labour is no longer the main productive force, and the length of working time is no longer the measure of wealth. Enterprises are replacing human work by computer-integrated automatic systems, which produce more, better and more flexibly with a smaller and smaller fraction of the workforce previously required. <a id="ind547a"/>Semi-skilled workers and labourers are increasingly being eliminated from industry, but so are the traditional craft workers in the metalworking industries, such as toolmakers, millers and fitters. Machine tools controlled by <a id="ind404a"/>microprocessors and <a id="ind197a"/>flexible manufacturing systems no longer require those skills. Industry needs people who are capable of independent teamwork, and of co-ordinating their initiatives and skills without having anyone to supervise them or give them orders. They have to take responsibility for a complex system of machines and robots which, above all, require maintenance and immediate repair whenever there is the slightest breakdown. These new skilled workers have to be committed to their work. They have to be able to adapt to rapidly changing techniques and to acquire new skills, both manual and intellectual. For doing so, the enterprise offers them a privileged status and salary.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> This trend is sometimes seen as a sign of the renewal of working-class attempts to achieve liberation, or at least achieve control over production.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> That is laughable, because the basic question is this: What fraction of the working class acquires these skills and this status? Today, less than <a id="page87"/>10 per cent. Tomorrow that stratum of &#x201C;modern expert workers&#x201D;, as <a id="ind334a"/>Kern and <a id="ind542a"/>Schumann call them, will come to represent 25 per cent of the workers in industry, and perhaps even 40 per cent in the metalworking industries, we are told. That&#x2019;s fine, but what will become of the other 75 or 60 per cent? What will they end up as? We know the answer already: they will become &#x201C;peripheral workers&#x201D;, condemned, as in years gone by, to perform the thankless <a id="ind675a"/>unskilled tasks, with no possibility of career advancement. For the most part, they will become temporary workers, with a precarious status, who can be taken on and laid off again according to the needs of the moment.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">But there is more. Peripheral workers and privileged new skilled workers make up a workforce that is constantly declining. In the long term, industry is tending to employ fewer and fewer people. The question, therefore, is not merely what fraction of the working class do the new privileged skilled workers represent? but also what fraction of the working population does the working class represent? What do the others do, those who have been eliminated &#x2013; how nice it would be to say &#x201C;liberated&#x201D; &#x2013; from industrial work? How do they live? How much do they earn?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">If work and involvement in industry are to have some meaning, it is impossible not to ask these questions. And if you ask them, it is impossible to rest content with the improvement of the conditions of one group of workers in one sector of industry, unless you are willing to see the new work elite become a corporatist, conservative stratum, caring only for the defence of its privileges. It is impossible to take the existence of this elite as a pretext for glorifying work &#x2013; all work &#x2013; since it is precisely the work of this stratum that explains why jobs &#x2013; full-time, permanent jobs &#x2013; are no longer available for the unemployed and for workers in precarious employment. To glorify the work of an industrial elite when there aren&#x2019;t enough jobs to go around is no longer to glorify the strength of the working class, but rather to induce that elite to see itself as distinct from the working class, and to break its ties of solidarity with it. And in fact this is what employers&#x2019; propaganda is doing.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> Overall, you are saying that technical change is destroying the working class. It is the working class that is disintegrating, not capitalism. You don&#x2019;t, then, believe any more in the possible unity of the working class and its central importance to any strategy for transforming society?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> That&#x2019;s not what I&#x2019;m saying. The front of labour &#x2013; of <a id="ind639a"/>trade-union struggle &#x2013; remains crucial, but there is no central front any more. Society won&#x2019;t be changed without a trade-union movement worthy of the name &#x201C;movement&#x201D;, but the creative impulses most often come from elsewhere. The central conflict is located at a level much deeper than labour <a id="page88"/><a id="ind709a"/>disputes. The worker elite is indeed a participant in this central conflict. I am not by any means saying that it is a corporatist and conservative stratum. I am saying only that we push it in that direction when we constantly invoke the work ethic and the ideology of productivism in a way that redounds to its credit. This is what Mrs <a id="ind626a"/>Thatcher did for ten years, with telling results. The task of the trade-union movement and trade-union policy is to open up a different path and other horizons for that elite. Instead of simply telling it that it is doing exciting work with which we can identify, we also have to tell it, in my opinion, that its work leads to there being less and less work for the rest of us. And that you can&#x2019;t seriously do work that leads to the elimination of work and at the same time exalt work as the essential source of each person&#x2019;s identity. For the new industrial <a id="ind567a"/>skilled workers, identifying with their occupation can&#x2019;t mean identifying with their job within a flexible manufacturing system while remaining deaf and blind to everything else. Identifying with their occupation means understanding it as a social skill, to be exercised in a responsible way. In other words, it means stepping back from the function they perform in production and asking themselves what social, economic and cultural ends it serves. In particular, it means considering the redistribution of work and the reduction of working hours as essential questions of the highest priority. It is, therefore, viewing work in the proper perspective, not identifying with it, that can lay the ground for trade-union power and unity. This is a basic difference from the traditional views of the working class and trade unionism.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> Ten years ago, you called those who didn&#x2019;t identify with their work the &#x201C;non-class of non-workers&#x201D;. You accorded them a crucial role in challenging capitalism. You were severely criticized for that view. How, in fact, can that movement ever become a co-ordinated social movement capable of sustained action to transform society? Moreover, hasn&#x2019;t mounting unemployment caused the allergy to wage labour, the non-identification with it, to disappear and be replaced by a frantic search for paid jobs of any kind?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> What I called the &#x201C;non-class of non-workers&#x201D; wasn&#x2019;t an identifiable and organizable stratum but the emergence of a thoroughgoing <a id="ind111a"/>cultural change, which has continued to gain ground ever since: individuals no longer identify with their work, even when it is interesting and skilled, because it usually appears to them as a functional specialization in the service of a megamachine on which they have no hold. They no longer identify with their place in the social process of production, nor do they derive from it the sense of belonging to a class. The social order has disintegrated; neither in their occupational role, nor in family structures, nor in the spatial structuring of their surroundings <a id="page89"/>can individuals find what the sociologists used to call a determinate &#x201C;identity&#x201D;, a reassuring social image of what they are. They are thrown back on themselves, and have to search for and develop themselves in ways that are not given in advance. Paid work is at best one dimension among others of that quest; it is seldom the most important.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">These themes have been variously developed since then. The Italian metalworkers&#x2019; union, <a id="ind194a"/>Fiom-CGIL, concluded in a quite recent report:</p><div class="block"><p class="bl_nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">we are engaged in a process of social change as a result of which work now occupies only a minor place in people&#x2019;s lives. More precisely, work &#x2013; paid work &#x2013; is losing its central position&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;Work is valued only when it has the quality of autonomous creative activity. Otherwise it is regarded merely as a way of earning a living.</p></div><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">In their most recent writings, <a id="ind615a"/>Franz Steink&#x00FC;hler, the leader of the German metalworkers&#x2019; union in Frankfurt, and <a id="ind649a"/>Bruno Trentin, secretary-general of the CGIL, state in almost identical terms that trade-union policy must consist in creating the social conditions that enable all individuals to realize their potential and fulfil themselves in activities of their own choice, whether paid or unpaid, and to choose their way of life and their working hours &#x2013; within the framework, of course, of negotiated agreements.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">This distancing from work is in no way confined to unskilled employees. Even among the most highly skilled, the capacity for <a id="ind31a"/>autonomy and initiative exceeds the degree of autonomy allowed or demanded by the functional specialization of work, however complex and responsible this work may be. Unlike the traditional labour movement, people are challenging the system not as agents of production but as people who cannot identify with their work and are not satisfied by it. As citizens, residents of a particular area, users of a public service, members of an association, or parents, they see their paid work in a wider context and conclude that their skills could be better employed, that industry could use less polluting and less energy-consuming technologies, that their quality of life could be improved if the requirements of economic rationality were subordinated to those of ecology, if production decisions were not made to get the best possible return on the largest possible amount of capital.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">You have, then, a multidimensional social movement that can no longer be defined in terms of class antagonisms, and in which people&#x2019;s aim is to reappropriate an environment that the megatools have alienated from them, to regain control of their lives by reappropriating the skills that have been taken from them by the expertocracies on which big business and big government base their domination. This movement <a id="page90"/>is essentially a struggle for collective and individual rights to self-determination, integrity, individual sovereignty. That struggle concerns all the different strata of wage-earners. It is fought in many different fields, and the company level is not always and not necessarily the most important of these. That&#x2019;s why the <a id="ind640a"/>trade-union movement has a future only if it expands beyond the workplace and equips itself with what <a id="ind650a"/>Bruno Trentin calls &#x201C;structures of movement&#x201D;, public forums accessible to all, and opens itself up to debate, to common action, to alliance with other movements.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> All in all, then, you are advocating political coalitions, new solidarities, and new alliances: between wage-earners in stable employment and the unemployed and precariously employed; between movements and parties. But do you believe that attempts to forge these solidarities and alliances can succeed?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> The question doesn&#x2019;t arise in precisely these terms. It isn&#x2019;t a matter of building coalitions or alliances between specific or sectoral interests &#x2013; between elite workers and the unemployed and precarious workers, for example &#x2013; but of winning new freedoms, new rights, which are by nature universal. People who set out to win or defend rights don&#x2019;t form either coalitions or alliances: they strive for what seems to them to be the common good, and that is what gives the movement its unity. This is the case with the women&#x2019;s movement, the anti-racist movement, and the movement for a healthy environment. The battle for a <a id="ind741a"/>reduction in working hours can be understood in this same way: as a struggle for a set of rights and freedoms, which may obviously assume highly differentiated forms, but whose contents are the same for everybody &#x2013; the right to learn, to study at any age (not simply to &#x201C;retrain&#x201D;), to bring up one&#x2019;s children, to engage in political or public activities, to stay at home with a sick or dying relative or friend, and so forth. These rights to what <a id="ind395a"/>Marx calls &#x201C;the free development of individuality&#x201D; presuppose having not only the available time but also the right to the self-management of one&#x2019;s time within relatively flexible limits.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">No insurmountable difficulties are raised, therefore, by the idea of bringing together all the different strata of wage-earners in solidarity, provided that the campaign for reducing working hours takes into account the diversity of situations involved. A reduction in weekly working hours isn&#x2019;t necessarily in everyone&#x2019;s interest. It may best suit those with stable employment, since their jobs require regular and continuous presence at the workplace. For a large number of <a id="ind568a"/>skilled personnel, however, a linear reduction of the working day and the working week is not a possibility, particularly in the case of computer programmers, designers, technicians involved in setting up and testing <a id="page91"/>new installations, and so on. A reduction in annual working hours in the form of weeks or months of extra leave, together with entitlement to sabbatical years, will be more appropriate for people in these occupations, since their work requires imagination, ideas, and the refreshing of multidisciplinary knowledge, all of which are less easily acquired at the workplace than in discussion, reading, travel, stepping back from the tasks of the moment and varying one&#x2019;s activities and interests. The idea that the specialist can keep abreast of things only by total devotion to his or her specialism bears no relation to reality. It merely serves the interests of a system of domination that seeks to imprison people in their specialist fields in order to prevent them from questioning, as citizens, the ends that the decision-makers are making them serve.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">Lastly, there is that 40 to 50 per cent of the working population for whom the economy offers only casual, temporary, <a id="ind450a"/>part-time employment: the unemployed and the precarious workers. The shrinking of the volume of work needed by the economy, which could be a source of freedom if it were distributed to all, is imposed as a deprivation on this fraction of the working population. These people, who can be hired and fired at will, are paid only for the work they do, not for their availability and capacity to work during the periods of forced <a id="ind658a"/>unemployment. If we examine their situation closely, we see that they are victims of a discrimination whose rationale is essentially ideological. They are used as an example to show that only time actually worked entitles a person to remuneration and, therefore, that working time must remain the measure of wealth and social usefulness. Now, these basic principles of capitalist ideology are, in fact, breached where the majority of workers in stable employment are concerned. Maintenance technicians, operators and controllers of automated plants, medical personnel, and workers in emergency services are paid for their availability and their capacity to intervene, not for work actually done. The ideology of maximum efficiency and of basing wages on the measurement of output is rendered obsolete by technological development. The case of the unemployed and precarious workers allows it to preserve a semblance of existence.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">That is why a French group, the <a id="ind21a"/>Association of the Unemployed and Precarious Workers, is demanding, in a wholly plausible and legitimate way, that people employed on a precarious basis as temporary or <a id="ind70a"/>casual workers should be given the <a id="ind296a"/>right, during periods when wage-labour is interrupted, to an income that remunerates them for remaining available for work. In exchange, they commit themselves to performing a certain annual amount of work, if it so happens that they are offered any. This is equivalent, in fact, to calling for a reduction in the working year and for the right to work intermittently without any substantial <a id="page92"/><a id="ind742a"/>reduction of income. The discontinuous nature of the wage relation is to be transformed into a new freedom instead of being suffered as a constraint imposed by management. There is nothing strange about such a demand. Until the 1910s, it was abnormal for a worker &#x2013; particularly a good craft worker &#x2013; to work in a stable job the whole year long. For those workers, frequent job changes, unemployment, travelling, and casual work were all ways of preserving their independence both from management and from wage-labour. That taste for change, for independence and autonomy, reappeared some time ago among a proportion of the workforce that is too large to be dismissed as insignificant. These workers, most of them young, prefer temporary work to stable, full-time employment, as this <a id="ind449a"/>leaves them free to engage in activities that are more fulfilling than most of those by which one can earn a living.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> This distancing from work no doubt has its positive side. But it is important to point out that in the OECD countries, between 70 and 90 per cent of <a id="ind451a"/>part-time workers, most of whom are in <a id="ind702a"/>precarious forms of employment, are women between twenty-five and forty-four years old, employed in the <a id="ind556a"/>service sector. For many of these women, working shortened hours means working a &#x201C;<a id="ind134a"/>double shift&#x201D;: unpaid work at home plus paid work &#x2013; generally poorly paid &#x2013; with no chance of career advancement. The result is that a great many women have much less free time and are more overworked than men.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> Quite so. It&#x2019;s doubly iniquitous and doubly scandalous.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">In the first place, the economic system produces increasing wealth with a decreasing quantity of work. Yet it refuses to redistribute the work in such a way that everyone can work less and better without loss of income. It prefers to have a section of the population working full-time, another section unemployed, and a third, which is constantly growing in numbers, working a shortened day for reduced pay.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">Furthermore, most full-time jobs are held by men and most jobs with reduced working hours by women. That is another scandal, which we shall be rid of only when paid working hours are reduced for everyone. If the normal working week were no more than thirty hours &#x2013; which is the target of the Left and of trade unions in the <a id="ind438a"/>Netherlands, <a id="ind311a"/>Italy and <a id="ind224a"/>Germany &#x2013; then the present sexual <a id="ind127a"/>division of labour would lose its economic foundation, and there would be no way to excuse it.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">This is certainly the trend. First, an increasing proportion of young <a id="ind188a"/>fathers are requesting shorter working hours or leave &#x2013; even unpaid leave &#x2013; in order to be able to look after their children. Four years ago, the figure was 12 per cent in the <a id="ind670a"/>United States. A year ago it was 26 per cent, and half of American firms offer their male employees the option <a id="page93"/>of working shorter <a id="ind729a"/>hours. Second, almost half of French, German and Swiss couples stay unmarried, and in half of these cases they don&#x2019;t live together. The children live with the mother, with the father, or with each in turn. This fundamentally changes the meaning of unpaid domestic labour. Women or men who live alone do their housework for themselves, not for the greater profit or comfort of their partner. So as this trend continues, there is no longer any sense in asking society to recognize the social usefulness of household labour by paying wages for housework. However, this development lends a greater urgency and enhanced legitimacy to the demand for the right to paid parental leave, a sabbatical year, or other forms of reducing time at work.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">This kind of right is often claimed on behalf of the &#x201C;social usefulness&#x201D; of the mother&#x2019;s (or father&#x2019;s) work in the home. The argument is that the social value of housework must be recognized as equal to the value of paid work. I don&#x2019;t agree with that approach, which takes as its basic criterion the individual&#x2019;s usefulness to society, because it implicitly denies the autonomy of the individual and the existence of his or her inalienable rights <span class="italic">upon</span> society. We must abandon the idea that society has priority and that individuals make themselves useful by reproducing it, and instead reverse the terms. Society will be better in so far as it acknowledges the rights of individuals to fulfil themselves, and grants them the opportunities for such fulfilment. The right to <a id="ind419a"/>motherhood, to fatherhood, to take care of one&#x2019;s body and one&#x2019;s habitat, to &#x201C;look after oneself&#x201D; and look after one&#x2019;s neighbour, must be unconditional and privileged. It is on this basis that society will be created.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> Isn&#x2019;t the extension of free time also a means of reducing over<a id="ind100a"/>consumption? The more commodities we consume, the more we need to work to buy them and the less time we have for other activities, including the activity of being citizens.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> Yes, and the opposite is true too: the more you work, the more you tend to consume commodities, but also to consume commodity services, since you don&#x2019;t have the time or energy to do things by and for yourself. The obligation to work full-time has been the key to economic growth in the affluent capitalist societies. The Swedish economist <a id="ind1a"/>Gunnar Adler-Karlson was, I think, the first to say this in his book <span class="italic">The Unimportance of Full Employment</span>. If we could adjust our working time to the needs we really feel, how many hours would we work? But this possibility of &#x201C;choosing our working hours&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t offered to us. It would enable us to limit our consumption of commodities, which has become an ecological imperative in the affluent nations. And the possibility of choosing our working hours will be all the greater a the normal weekly or annual working hours become shorter.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><a id="page94"/><span class="bold">Keane:</span> In <span class="italic"><a id="ind59a"/>Ecology as Politics</span>, you adopt two contradictory points of view. On the one hand you say that the <a id="ind146a"/>ecological approach is incompatible with capitalist rationality; on the other you argue that capitalism will eventually accept ecological imperatives, just as it eventually accepted universal suffrage and the forty-hour week. Thus, according to you, these imperatives mustn&#x2019;t be ends in themselves for the <a id="ind254a"/>Green movement. Why this ambiguity?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> The ecological movement can&#x2019;t be reduced to the demand that the environment be protected. If it is, its demands will end up sooner or later being taken on board by capitalism &#x2013; and nothing will change. We shall have &#x2013; we already have &#x2013; eco-business and an eco-industry, and we could have a techno-ecosphere, if not indeed techno-ecofascism as described in science fiction. Capitalism may develop a highly profitable eco-business, just as it developed a highly profitable arms industry, to meet public contracts. And in response to new pollution standards, it may better eliminate and recycle industrial waste products and adopt different, more capital-intensive technologies, at the cost of higher prices and increased inequalities. This is the direction in which we are going at the moment: the growing pauperization of the poor and the increasing affluence of the well-off.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">Unlike what is called &#x201C;<a id="ind179a"/>environmentalism&#x201D; in the Anglo-Saxon countries, political ecology does not confine itself to trying to reduce the impact of the existing system of production on the environment. It challenges the reasons behind the development of a certain number of technologies, products, and forms of consumption in the first place. These reasons are contained in the logic of capitalist accumulation: it has to be possible for increasing quantities of capital to be invested at a profit, and this requires the consumption of an increasing flow of commodities and commodity services. The population, therefore, has to be induced to satisfy its needs through a maximum of consumption, and a maximum number of needs for commodity consumption have to be created. Now, many needs could be satisfied by a less intense flow of better, more durable products, and consumer needs themselves could be reduced by a more relaxed and convivial style of life that left more free time. We could live and work better by consuming less, provided that we consumed differently. It would not then be possible for technologies, social relations, our model of consumption, or our relation to nature to remain the same.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">The &#x201C;environmentalist&#x201D; and &#x201C;ecological&#x201D; approaches are therefore fundamentally different from each other. The former imposes new constraints and new limitations on the free operation of <a id="ind168a"/><a id="ind518a"/>economic rationality as developed by capitalism. But these constraints and limitations <a id="page95"/>don&#x2019;t alter the basic tendency of the system, which is to extend the sphere of economic rationality and increase the value of rising amounts of capital. The ecological approach, in contrast, involves a paradigm shift, which may be summarized in the slogan &#x201C;less but better&#x201D;. It aims to reduce the sphere in which economic rationality and commodity exchanges apply, and to subordinate it to non-quantifiable societal and cultural ends and to the free development of individuals. The ecological restructuring of the economy envisaged within the Left in <a id="ind225a"/>Germany and the <a id="ind439a"/>Netherlands and within the Italian extreme Left thus necessarily has an anti-capitalist, socialist direction to it. Investment can no longer have economic growth as its goal, but only negative growth and an accompanying expansion of those activities not governed by monetary evaluation and the pursuit of maximum efficiency and profit.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> The German &#x201C;<a id="ind255a"/>Greens&#x201D; were the first to popularize the idea of a guaranteed <a id="ind575a"/>social income, or &#x201C;<a id="ind673a"/>universal grant&#x201D;. This idea is now making headway all over Europe, particularly in the Netherlands, where it is supported by all the Left movements, by some of the trade unions, and by many influential personalities. It is being debated in <a id="ind312a"/>Italy, and it has given rise in <a id="ind206a"/>France to the creation of the &#x201C;minimum insertion income&#x201D;. A guaranteed social income for everyone is regarded by many as a citizen&#x2019;s right &#x2013; the right to a &#x201C;citizenship wage&#x201D;. It could also be the most important way of <a id="ind710a"/>redistributing paid work fairly and reducing the length of working hours. Now, you have come out against such a formula on several occasions. You would rather have a system that guarantees every citizen a normal wage throughout his or her lifetime in exchange for performing over that lifetime a quantity of work, which would decrease and become more and more intermittent as social productivity increased. It is often held against you that by linking the right to an income with the right to work, you are crucially linking the right to an income with an obligation to work. Isn&#x2019;t there a contradiction between an obligation of this kind and the break with the ideology of work that you advocate elsewhere?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> I consider utopian, in the bad sense of the term, ideal objectives that don&#x2019;t indicate new possibilities for emancipatory action. This is the critique I would make, as <a id="ind271a"/>J&#x00FC;rgen Habermas does, of <a id="ind17a"/>Hannah Arendt&#x2019;s disciples, who see the &#x201C;citizenship wage&#x201D; as a way to revive the ideal of the <a id="ind469a"/>Greek polis. I see two fundamental defects in this universal-allowance idea.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">The first is that an allowance of this kind, in exempting people from performing any paid work, fails to create a public space for non-economic activities. Economic activity today occupies the public space to an exaggerated extent, and Arendt was right to wish to press it back, <a id="page96"/><a id="ind716a"/><a id="ind743a"/>allowing more scope for political activities, activities that concern the &#x201C;common good&#x201D;. It will not, however, be ousted from that space by paying an allowance to those who stay outside the economic sphere, and thereby remain outside what is today the most important dimension of the public sphere. On the contrary, an allowance that exempts people from any work within the economic sphere will deepen the split within society. Economic activity will become the province of production-mad, profit-hungry individuals. They will tend to monopolize the public space and marginalize the non-working recipients of state allowances, who will then be condemned to a life of private activities and social oblivion. If you want other activities to supplant work within the public space, then the importance of work has to be reduced through organized public action, which simultaneously opens up the public space to activities whose ends are not economic, and helps to establish such activities in that space. That is why, in my opinion, we have to come at the problem &#x201C;from below&#x201D;, by reducing the number of working hours. And this has to be conceived not as a single measure but as a long-term, general policy, concerning both government and <a id="ind641a"/>trade unions, and embodying an alternative view of civilization. Trade-union action &#x2013; action by trade unions with a much broader conception of their role and, as argued by <a id="ind434a"/>Negt in <a id="ind226a"/>Germany and <a id="ind651a"/>Trentin in <a id="ind313a"/>Italy, a different structure &#x2013; is indispensable if that objective is to be achieved. This is true, first, because only the (renovated) trade union can organize the population in the public space of work and open up that space to public activities outside the workplace; and second, because the shortening of working hours has to be worked out in concrete detail, and applied through collective action and bargaining at all levels. A new &#x201C;contract for society&#x201D; has to be established so that social relations can be transformed. A universal allowance created by a law and paid out by an administrative agency would not have the same scope.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">The right to work has to be understood in this context &#x2013; as a <span class="italic">political</span> right of access to what is currently the chief activity within the public sphere and to the powers that access confers, in particular the power to participate in decisions relating to the organization of economic activity and its place in society. It is quite conceivable, of course, that the unemployed should take part, by rights, with their own associations, in the formulation of trade-union policy. But unemployment then has to be understood as a temporary and partial interruption of participation in economic activity, not as a choice not to participate in it at all. By opening up this right to non-participation, the universal-grant idea in fact creates two categories of citizen, and gives society the right to perpetuate forms of social exclusion.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">The second defect of the universal grant can be seen if we approach <a id="page97"/><a id="ind744a"/>the problem from the opposite angle. A certain quantity of work is essential for the existence of society and social individuals. That necessity is imposed by the nature of things, not by a social obligation. In the ancient <a id="ind470a"/>polis, economically necessary work was confined to the private sphere and reserved for women and slaves. The private sphere was the sphere of authoritarian constraint, whereas the public sphere was the sphere of free citizens, of men freed from the burden of necessity. The emancipation of the slaves reversed this type of political order. The equality and freedom of individuals now requires that necessary work be socially organized in the public sphere, where everyone participates. No one must bear the burden of necessity for the benefit of others, and no one, therefore, must be exempted from bearing his or her share of that burden. Now, the universal-grant idea opens up the right to exemption. It allows society not to concern itself with distributing the burden equitably. In so doing, out of idealism, it plays along with the ideology of work: it seems to consider work as an elective, optional activity, which can be reserved for those who like doing it. But the point is that work has to be done, whether we like it or not, and it is only by starting out from the recognition of its necessity that we can try to make it as pleasant and fulfilling as possible, to lessen its intensity and shorten its duration.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">Admittedly, not all necessary work can be organized socially in the public sphere, nor should it be. There is a sphere within which individuals must belong to themselves and sovereignly produce themselves, free from all control and from social norms. This is the private sphere. Necessary work within that sphere cannot have the same status as work in the public sphere. I call this &#x201C;work-for-oneself&#x201D;. It is ambivalent, being at once burdensome and gratifying, or each of these in turn, depending on the circumstances. Not doing such work means entrusting it to servants. It is mainly made up of all the various activities of self-maintenance. Such work will be less burdensome and more gratifying as free time is more abundant, on a daily, weekly and yearly basis.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> If working time is gradually reduced to the point where paid work becomes intermittent, what will people live on during the intervals between work? You have spoken of a guaranteed social income spread out over a lifetime, to be paid in exchange for a decreasing amount of work. But employers, and even a large number of trade unions, will tell you that the cost of such a system would be beyond what the economy could bear.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> The six-day week and the eight-hour day were originally regarded as ruinous demands. The present social security system would have seemed completely unrealistic seventy years ago. At the beginning of the <a id="page98"/>century, full-time employment meant working more than three thousand hours a year. In 1960, the figure was twenty-one hundred. In 1985, it was sixteen hundred hours, yet this volume of work, which was 25 per cent lower than the 1960 figure, produced a GNP two-and-a-half times higher. In his latest book, <a id="ind119a"/>Jacques Delors points out that in 1946, a twenty-year-old wage-earner could expect to spend a third of his or her waking life at work. By 1975, this had fallen to a quarter, and today it is less than a fifth. He adds that this development will continue, and that it should &#x201C;give rise to other logics of production and exchange&#x201D;. In fact, if you consider the different types of leave from work, whether paid or covered by insurance, full-time work is already intermittent. There is no reason why we shouldn&#x2019;t gradually get back to an average of one thousand working hours a year &#x2013; which was the norm in the eighteenth century &#x2013; or twenty to thirty thousand hours a lifetime, enabling everyone successively to adopt several lifestyles, jobs, careers, or types of activity without ever ceasing to receive a full wage. We have to get used to thinking of free time as a major part of life, not as just the inferior time left over after work. It is the time in which paid work is done that has to become &#x2013; and, in fact, already is &#x2013; secondary in importance.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> But if people are to be paid uninterruptedly for increasingly discontinuous work, what will force them to resume socially necessary activity after several months&#x2019; or even one or two years&#x2019; break? If people are actually to do the amount of work that entitles them to a guaranteed income during their lifetimes, won&#x2019;t a whole system of bureaucratic controls be needed? Won&#x2019;t people have to possess a logbook, as they did in <a id="ind113a"/>Czechoslovakia, for example, recording the exact amount of work they have performed?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> Your <a id="ind454a"/>pension fund already contains a record of the number of weeks and months you have worked and what you have earned over your lifetime. Instead of being paid from the age of fifty-five &#x2013; or even fifty &#x2013; onwards for a period of complete inactivity that will continue until you die, why shouldn&#x2019;t you be entitled to spread that out economically &#x2013; but not socially &#x2013; inactive period over your life? It is no more difficult to manage by computer. A number of points is allocated for each working period, and these entitle you to a certain period of leave, paid on the basis of the average of what you have earned in your previous jobs. If you go too long without working, the computer sends you a letter warning you that you have only three months, say, to find work again. And the system could be combined with regulatory incentives. If, for some reason or other, there is a sudden need for nursing staff or bricklayers, the right to leave could be suspended and those on leave encouraged to work; they might, for example, be offered a higher number of points for going <a id="page99"/>back to work. The Swedish economist <a id="ind523a"/>G&#x00F6;sta Rehn was the first to propose a system of this kind, with incentives added, allowing people to take a kind of advance on their retirement at any age. One can imagine half a dozen other schemes, and raise objections to each of them. I am not defending any particular system, but I am saying there is a need to imagine a way out of the &#x201C;work-based society&#x201D; towards a society in which activities performed for non-economic ends &#x2013; whether public or private, social or personal &#x2013; will be preponderant.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> But these will still have to be financed, since you yourself do not believe in a society without money in which everything would be free. This presupposes fiscal and monetary policy.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> That policy must reconcile three types of interest that appear to be contradictory: first, the legitimate interest of people who don&#x2019;t want their real incomes to fall when their working hours are reduced; second, the legitimate interest of enterprises, whether public or private, which can be managed efficiently and with foresight only if they know their real costs and are not made to pay people they don&#x2019;t actually need; third, the legitimate interest of society, which has to be able to establish priorities and discourage certain forms of consumption and production by deterrent <a id="ind622a"/>taxes similar to those that already exist, from which export products are exempt.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">We have to conceive, then, a way of financing all this that does not burden either the incomes of working individuals or the manufacturing costs of enterprises. This is the case with taxes on consumption, of the VAT type, which could be very greatly increased on those industrial products whose relative prices are continually falling. These taxes would supply a fund that would pay people their incomes during non-working periods. But you could also envisage having different types of money &#x2013; for example, a &#x201C;circulation money&#x201D; that couldn&#x2019;t be hoarded, a &#x201C;neighbourhood money&#x201D;, for trading services, that could not circulate, and so forth. In short, &#x201C;other logics of production and exchange&#x201D;, as <a id="ind120a"/>Jacques Delors says.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">A political strategy centred on the reduction of working hours may be the main lever with which we can shift the balance within society, and put an end to the domination of the political sphere by the economic. And this would mean the extinction of capitalism.</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="bold">Keane:</span> Perhaps not. It might also lead to a post-Keynesian era that would leave privately controlled capital a significant role, albeit reduced by comparison with the previous period. Aren&#x2019;t you supposing that capitalism can be destroyed by stealth, and that capitalists resemble old men on their deathbeds, ready to sign <a id="ind65a"/>over their estates?</p><p class="extract0 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><a id="page100"/><span class="bold">Gorz:</span> I&#x2019;m quite happy to accept what you call &#x201C;a significant role, albeit reduced&#x201D;, for capital. That is precisely what is meant by the extinction of capital<span class="italic">ism</span>. We have to distinguish between capitalism and the logic of capital. Capitalism is a social system in which life, activities, the scale of values, and the aims of individuals and society are all dominated by relations subordinated to economic rationality and directed towards the valorization of capital. The logic of capital, by contrast, is the only form of pure economic rationality. There is no economically rational way to run an enterprise other than capitalist management. That is an obvious fact which everyone has come to acknowledge. But it doesn&#x2019;t mean that all enterprises and activities have to obey capitalist management, or that the pure economic rationality such management represents must, or even can, take priority over all other considerations, at the level either of the enterprise or of society as a whole. The criterion of economic efficiency demands the pursuit of the greatest possible productivity per unit of (dead or live) labour. In practice, this means the pursuit of maximum profit. But this criterion is applicable only to a restricted area of what <a id="ind396a"/>Marx called our &#x201C;exchanges with nature&#x201D;. The application of the criterion of measurable productivity has, then, to be restricted by the application of criteria of a totally different kind. When these criteria win out over the logic of capital in public decision-making and individual behaviour, and assign economic rationality the subordinate role of a means in the service of non-economic ends, then we shall have got beyond capitalism to a different society, if not indeed a different civilization.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">Of course, you might object that the capitalists will resist fiercely, and their resistance will have to be overcome. How? By whom? This brings us back to the problem I mentioned a moment ago. There is a central conflict, but no central front; there are antagonisms similar to the class struggle, but no class capable of hegemony. Who got the better of the formidable political and financial power of the <a id="ind441a"/>nuclear industry in <a id="ind617a"/>Sweden, <a id="ind22a"/>Austria, <a id="ind621a"/>Switzerland, <a id="ind227a"/>Germany, Italy? Who turned such things as the extinction of species, the destruction of the tropical rainforests, the hole in the ozone layer, global warming, the pollution of groundwater, industrial agriculture, and factory livestock farming into themes of a debate that confronts all political forces throughout Europe, and seems ready to lead not just to technocratic measures but to radical structural reforms?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">There is a movement, a change; we&#x2019;re seeing transverse alliances that cut across class boundaries. Each of us knows some capitalist or other &#x2013; a top manager in the chemical industry, for example &#x2013; who is racked with doubt about what he is doing, and wonders what his deathbed assessment of his life&#x2019;s work will be, or what his great-grandchildren will think <a id="page101"/>of him. Cultural change and ideas have a force of their own, even on people whose interests they upset. Admittedly, the managers of the capitalist megamachine won&#x2019;t be converted spontaneously to ecological self-limitation and socialist democracy. But quite a few of them will be relieved and even prepared to co-operate when public pressure and legislators ask them to serve goals more defensible than merely maximizing profit to the detriment of people&#x2019;s health and the quality of life.</p><p class="right1 EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><span class="italic">Translated by Chris Turner in<br/>collaboration with Andr&#x00E9; Gorz</span></p><div class="footnote"><p class="line EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart"><img src="images/Gorz_9781781680384_epub_L02_r1GrigorMalogrig3275ormalogmailcom.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="1"/></p><p class="footnote EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart" id="c08-ftn1"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c08_r13837GrigorMalogrigormalogmailcom.htm#c08-ftn1a">&#x002A;</a><span class="italic">Translator&#x2019;s note</span>: This interview, which was carried out in 1990, was first published in <span class="italic">Grand Street</span> 38, New York 1991.</p></div><p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: center; color: #666; border-top: 1px solid #9a9a9a; padding: 15px 0 0; margin: 50px 0 0;" class="EPubfirstparagraph EpubPagerstart">This eBook is licensed to Grigor Malo, grigormalo@gmail.com on 09/13/2018</p></body></html>
