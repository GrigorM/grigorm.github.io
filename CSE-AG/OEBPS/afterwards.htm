To misappropriate a phrase of <a id="ind445a"/>Claus Offe&#x2019;s: it will be more important to guarantee a European minimum than to achieve national maximums. It would seem to me, from a universalist standpoint, more important to introduce the &#x201C;liberal&#x201D; measure of a guaranteed minimum income for immigrants, combined with civil rights and the right to seek employment, than to achieve the &#x201C;socialist&#x201D; variant of a guaranteed income for life linked to a specific quantity of work to be performed over that lifetime. The contradiction between equality before the law and social inequality would not, of course, be resolved by such a measure: it would merely secure a space in which it could be fought out and publicly negotiated.</p><p class="extract">Gorz makes the following comments on these observations:</p><p class="extract2">If the increase in the total workforce is to be regulated by immigration criteria and quotas &#x201C;negotiated at the European level&#x201D; (which I accept), why should this make &#x201C;the macro-economic aspects&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;considerably more complicated&#x201D;? Can European immigration quotas be anything other than the sum of the foreseeable regional capacities to admit migrants? In order to guarantee immigrants not just the formal right but also the real <span class="italic">possibility</span> of &#x201C;mov[ing] freely and compet[ing] <span class="italic">legally</span> within the European labour market&#x201D; (again, accepted), does this not mean that the development of the market, of productivity and of the skills required, must be planned at enterprise, industry and regional level, and a corresponding policy of vocational training and work redistribution implemented? Or, my dear friends Otto and Claus, do you envisage a neo-Liberal, Friedmannite policy with the sweeping away of all collective wage agreements and social insurance measures in favour of a guaranteed minimum income, in order that immigrants may find work, in an entirely de-regulated labour market, by bypassing the (disempowered) trade unions and undercutting the wages of the &#x201C;local&#x201D; workers.</p><p class="indent">Why do you take the view that immigrants would be entitled only to &#x201C;minimum guarantees&#x201D;? Why shouldn&#x2019;t they receive the full incomes I envisage here in <a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c09_r1GrigorMalogrigormalogmail9410com.htm">Chapter 9</a>. Why shouldn&#x2019;t the social contract guaranteeing a full income during the periodic interruptions of waged employment and in retirement also apply to immigrants. And why shouldn&#x2019;t they take part in the collective bargaining process? Who would gain from the fact of only minimums being guaranteed, and the whole dynamic of distribution struggles, collective bargaining and the effort to expand the contractual social net <span class="italic">as far as possible</span> being halted? Are you not, perhaps, forgetting that this is still a capitalist society, that the antagonism between labour and capital still remains, even when the trade unions have grown bureaucratic and the working class in the advanced industries has become corporatist and conservative? And that the reduction of all guarantees to a minimum would only increase the rate of profit, the power of capital and its <a id="page142"/>room for manoeuvre? Possible European minimums will always depend on national minimums <span class="italic">and maximums</span> &#x2013; that is, on the balance of social forces.</p><p class="indent">Finally &#x2013; to quote <a id="ind330a"/>Kant &#x2013; one should always defend utopia (i.e. the norm of the greatest possible equity) against those who base themselves on what currently exists.
