Medium- and long-term policies, implemented both by the unions and by government, are required if everyone is to be entitled to socially useful work, to the development of their capacities, to a <a id="ind745a"/>reduction in working hours without loss of earnings and to the increasing self-management of their time.</p>    <p class="indent">Such a policy is outlined in the following pages, which were originally written for French trade unionists who had argued at a seminar that working hours could not be reduced without loss of earnings if additional jobs were to be created as a result. &#x201C;If paid work is distributed over a greater number of people,&#x201D; they said, &#x201C;isn&#x2019;t it inevitable that each person&#x2019;s income will be lower?&#x201D; We shall see that this need not be so. So as not to complicate matters needlessly, the first part of this chapter is confined to a macro-economic argument, but leaves aside the diminution of unit costs which, in capital-intensive companies, may result from a more extended use of existing machinery made possible by reduced working hours (RWH).</p> <h2 class="B_HEAD">Working Hours, Pay and Employment</h2>    <p class="nonindent">RWH is both desirable and necessary. It is desirable in so far as it gives each person more freedom in the way they organize their life, more freedom to engage in varied pursuits and thus to enrich their lives. It is necessary to the extent that advances in productivity make it possible to produce more with less work. If everyone is to be able to find work, the quantity of work performed by each person must progressively diminish. On this point there is a more or less general agreement.</p> <p class="indent"><a id="page103"/>As soon as we go beyond general principles, however, there is such confusion regarding ways and means that RWH, instead of bringing unity, creates division between the holders of steady jobs, on the one hand, and the unemployed or holders of <a id="ind71a"/>casual or contingent jobs, on the other. All advocates of an RWH policy, including the <a id="ind351a"/>Left alternative theorists, continue to assert that present levels of <a id="ind498a"/>purchasing power could not be maintained if working hours were reduced. Such an assertion is understandable when it comes from members of the <a id="ind256a"/>Green movement who stand apart by choice from the labour movement and the Left. For them, the aim must be to bring about <span class="italic">a negative growth</span> in industrial and commodity production for the benefit of &#x201C;own-use&#x201D; <a id="ind20a"/>artisanal production and non-commodity exchange of services. They therefore declare themselves in favour of an RWH with a proportionate reduction in earnings. They do not say it would be impossible to earn as much as in the past when fewer hours are worked; they say it would not be desirable.</p>    <p class="indent">Among the immense majority of economists, by contrast, including those of the alternative Left, the maintenance of present levels of purchasing power is regarded as an economic impossibility. <a id="ind368a"/>Alain Lipietz, for example, who is no advocate of <a id="ind755a"/>zero growth (nor, <span class="italic">a fortiori</span>, of negative growth), estimates that compensatory payment for the hours cut could be made at only 70 per cent of the previous wage level, and that if one wishes to guarantee those workers who earn up to twice the statutory minimum wage the maintenance of their purchasing power, &#x201C;this means a more drastic reduction for salaries exceeding 8,000 francs [&#x00A3;930] per month&#x201D;. This means that the RWH policy would very probably alienate the most educated and influential fraction of the active, employed population from the outset.</p> <p class="indent">But by what reasoning do economists assert that purchasing power has to fall when working hours are reduced? The point is by no means scientifically proven. Do we not work half as many hours today as at the beginning of the century, and yet receive real incomes that are not half the size but five times bigger? Why, when sources of <a id="ind486a"/>productivity gains are far from exhausted, could we not keep our current level of purchasing power in the future?</p>    <p class="indent">A number of trade unionists said to me recently, &#x201C;All right, productivity gains can finance shorter working hours with no loss of income. But if you want to create extra jobs as well, so as to reduce <a id="ind659a"/>unemployment, you&#x2019;ll have to reduce wages.&#x201D;</p> <p class="indent">The fact is that they were wrong, as I shall demonstrate in a moment, unless we assume a situation of zero growth. Despite what they say, for as long as not only productivity but also output continue to grow &#x2013; even slightly &#x2013; it is possible to do everything at once: reduce working hours, <a id="page104"/>bring about a fall in unemployment and maintain, or even increase, incomes.</p>    <p class="indent">If we find it so hard to admit this possibility &#x2013; and to desire it &#x2013; this is because we always reason <span class="italic">ex post</span>, as economists say &#x2013; that is, starting out from a situation which is the final outcome of a <span class="italic">past</span> development. From this point of view, the die is already cast: the fruits of economic growth and <a id="ind487a"/>productivity gains have always <span class="italic">already been shared out</span>. They cannot be distributed a second time, between a greater number of people, without reducing the share each person receives.</p>          <p class="indent">But what seems impossible retrospectively becomes possible if we reason <span class="italic">ex ante</span> on the best way to allocate the fruits of a development that is <span class="italic">yet to come</span>. The division of the spoils then becomes a matter of political decision as to how the future is to be shaped.</p>    <p class="indent">The questions we then face are the following: what productivity gains can we expect over the next four or five years? And what increases in output? How are they to be divided between (a) a reduction in working hours, (b) the creation of additional jobs, and (c) improving wages and social benefits?</p>    <p class="indent">In short, the point is to steer a process which is actually in progress by choosing the needs it is to serve. Either politics is the sum of such choices, or it is nothing.</p>    <p class="indent">Let us look at the range of political choices currently available to us. To begin with, I shall take the rates of economic growth and the productivity gains of these last few years as a base, projecting them forward over the next four years. I shall even underestimate them to a small degree, so as to be forearmed against possible random fluctuations and against the accusation of being unrealistic. Let us, therefore, forecast the following course of development.<sup class="frac"><a class="hlink" id="c09-ftn1a" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c09_r1GrigorMalogrigormalogmail9410com.htm#c09-ftn1">&#x002A;</a></sup></p>        <h2 class="B_HEAD">A.

In a complex, developed economy, it is practically impossible to do much better than this, unless one creates a lot of unskilled and petty jobs, which is not the objective.</p><p class="indent">It is worth pointing out in passing, however, that if productivity and output increase at the same rate of 12 per cent in four years, wages could increase by 4 per cent and the workforce by 8 per cent for working hours that are reduced by 8 per cent (to a 36-hour week). This, however, is a hypothesis which we would do better not to envisage. Sustained growth in the volume of production is incompatible with the <a id="ind147a"/>ecological restructuring that is now on the agenda in all the industrialized countries, where the link between producing more and living better has been broken.</p><p class="indent">In order to live better, we now have to produce and consume differently, to do better and more with less, by eliminating sources of waste to begin with (for example, unnecessary packaging, poor heat insulation, the predominance of road transport) and by increasing product durability.</p><p class="extract"><span class="bold">B</span>. Let us suppose, then, that as a result of its efforts to eliminate waste, extend the life of products, change agricultural methods and reduce the causes of accidents and illness, ecological restructuring had the effect of halting economic growth. Let us also suppose that productivity does not rise by more than 9 per cent in four years. How will <a id="ind756a"/>zero growth modify the options that remain open? In this case, there will only be three possibilities:</p><p class="extract"><span class="italic">1. We maintain current working hours</span></p><p class="extract0">The workforce falls by 9 per cent in this case, since the same level of output requires 9 per cent less work, and those who retain their jobs can earn 9 per cent more. It&#x2019;s just bad luck for the others.</p><p class="extract"><span class="italic"><a id="page107"/><a id="ind533a"/>2. We maintain the workforce at the current level</span></p><p class="extract0">Since we can produce as much with 9 per cent less work, working hours can be reduced by 9 per cent (to approximately 35 hours per week) without any cut in wages.</p><p class="extract"><span class="italic">3. We reduce working hours while increasing the workforce by 4 per cent</span></p><p class="extract0">There will then be 4 per cent more of us to achieve a level of output which requires 9 per cent less work. Working hours can therefore be reduced by about 13 per cent (34 hours a week). But wages will have to be reduced by 4 per cent as the same volume of wealth has to be shared out among 4 per cent more workers.</p><p class="indent">It must be emphasized here that wages do not have to be reduced <span class="italic">in proportion</span> to the reduction in working hours: for working hours set at 87 per cent of the previous level, wages will be 96 per cent of what they were before. This corresponds to the hypothesis advanced by Alain Lipietz of paying compensation for the hours that have been cut at 70 per cent of the previous wage level. But <span class="italic">this hypothesis applies only if there is <a id="ind757a"/>zero growth</span>. That is why the question arises: should we opt, from the outset, for zero (or even negative) growth, as the ecologists think?</p><p class="indent">The answer to this question will determine the system of alliances on which a policy of ecological restructuring can be based, and its chances of being accepted socially. Choosing zero growth means, in fact, that a third of all job-holders &#x2013; those at the top of the scale &#x2013; who are also the most influential politically and culturally will have to accept reductions in their <a id="ind499a"/>purchasing power. These reductions will not easily be accepted, since it will be necessary not only to maintain or even improve the real incomes of the workers at the bottom of the scale but also to raise the general level of skills and qualifications, and increase the proportion of highly skilled jobs. It is, in fact, these latter that will have to grow most rapidly in the wake of a substantial RWH. Can we increase the number of skilled jobs and, at the same time, reduce the levels of remuneration for such jobs? Can we expect the most skilled workers alone to suffer the drawbacks of a policy of RWH <span class="italic">before they have even been able to discover its advantages</span>?</p><p class="indent">I do not believe so. If we want the &#x201C;strong&#x201D; to show solidarity with the &#x201C;weak&#x201D;, and if we want the RWH to respond to the interests and meet the aspirations of both the working elites and the unemployed or casually employed, then it is better, <span class="italic">in the initial stages</span>, for the economy to continue to grow a little, as it has continued to do, so as to be able both to cut back on unemployment and increase wages while reducing working hours (see scenario A 4). Everything will become easier <a id="page108"/>thereafter, in the second four-year period, with the coming of the thirty-two-hour week, the elimination of most of the residual unemployment and the acceleration of a process of ecological restructuring enabling us to live better while consuming, producing and working less, but better.</p><div class="textbox"><p class="center_head">BEYOND ECONOMICS</p><p class="textbox">Society must aim today not to produce the greatest possible wealth but to enable everyone to engage in productive and disinterested activities which ensure their place in society and their personal development&#x00A0;&#x2026;</p><p class="textbox1">If the government were to acknowledge that wage-based society was running out of steam, it would have to recognize its responsibility for developing these disinterested activities. <a id="ind725a"/>Work-sharing will be the more willingly accepted if everyone can engage in projects of personal development outside their work. The more attractive these disinterested activity projects are, the readier people will be to accept stable wages or only a slight progression in incomes.</p><p class="right2"><span class="small">GUY ROUSTANG</span>, <span class="italic">L&#x2019;emploi: un choix de soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9;</span>, Paris 1987.</p></div><h2 class="section">How is a General RWH to be <a id="ind192a"/>Financed?</h2><p class="nonindent">Up until now, I have only demonstrated the theoretical possibility, on the macro-economic level, of a generalized reduction in working hours and unemployment, without loss of income. But this is in no way to confront the problem of implementing such a policy in the different branches of industry and enterprises. Reductions in working hours certainly cannot be made dependent on productivity gains achieved at enterprise or branch level. Such a policy would result in a twenty-eight-hour week for workers in the banking sector, while hospital staff would be working fifty-six hours for the same wage. The tendency for wages and working conditions to equalize out cannot be resisted. When it is not produced by the workings of the job market, such an equalization is, in the end, imposed by social struggles. Thus, to plan for a general reduction in working hours, equal for all, is both to obey the dictates of realism and to act with a sense of fairness. I will add immediately that <span class="italic">an RWH equal for all in no way prevents</span>, <span class="italic">but actually facilitates a policy of &#x201C;free choice of working hours</span>&#x201D; &#x2013; that is, the adoption of individual patterns of working hours spread over the day, week, month or year.</p><p class="indent">Yet how are we to proceed so that an RWH equal for all &#x2013; for example, 12 per cent in four years&#x2019; time &#x2013; really produces a situation in which a <a id="page109"/>greater proportion of the active population can share in the fruits of <a id="ind488a"/>productivity and growth? An RWH of 12 per cent will not, in fact, prevent shrinkages of the workforce in the branches (metalworking, chemicals, banks, postal services, railways, etc.) where productivity is increasing at a much quicker rate. By contrast, in the activities where productivity is increasing more slowly, the recruitment of additional staff has little chance of occurring spontaneously and in the arithmetically predictable quantities. There are several reasons for this.</p><p class="indent">First of all, the type of <a id="ind676a"/>skill in the branches which are laying off labour does not immediately match the needs in the branches where productivity is stagnant. Second, when the normal working hours diminish by 12 per cent, for example, the workforces in these industries would have to increase by approximately 14 per cent (for the sake of simplicity I leave out of account productivity gains due to RWH itself); wage costs would therefore increase proportionately, and in many cases would, in the end, become prohibitive. Repair and maintenance services, for example, would continue to disappear: instead of having things repaired, they would be thrown away, except where they were designed to be repaired easily. On the other hand, the hotel and catering services and health and <a id="ind460a"/>personal care would carry on becoming more concentrated and splitting into two groups: a &#x201C;hand-made&#x201D; sector offering personalized services to a small client-base which can afford its high rates, and an &#x201C;off-the-peg&#x201D;, industrialized sector offering standardized, low-quality services to all-comers.</p><p class="indent">The development of this second category of services does, admittedly, create jobs, but it is a <span class="italic">net</span> creator of jobs only to the extent that, thanks to the drop in the relative price of services, it succeeds in reaching a new client-base. This fall in relative prices is itself possible only by virtue of an industrial rationalization of work which transforms artisanal activities into jobs with high productivity, but low skills and low wages. This is what has happened in the <a id="ind671a"/>United States. The contraction in the number of stable jobs, paid at a rate equal to or higher than the median wage, has been accompanied by the rise in casual activities, paid at a rate far below the median wage and often below the legal minimum. Almost half of the American labour force are in precarious, part-time jobs of this kind, and do not work all the year round. Society has split into two almost equal parts.</p><p class="indent">The options here are clear. If we wish to reduce unemployment, as in the USA, by creating a great number of jobs in the commodity <a id="ind557a"/>service sector, we have to accept the &#x201C;<a id="ind602a"/>dual society&#x201D; in which a growing part of the population will perform underpaid and underskilled work, most often in the service of members of the workforce who still have steady, full-time jobs in the productive sector. Conversely, if we wish to avoid the &#x201C;dual society&#x201D;, then, as <a id="ind534a"/>Guy Roustang has so convincingly shown,<a id="c09-nts2a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c09_r1GrigorMalogrigormalogmail9410com.htm#c09-nts2"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a> we cannot <a id="page110"/>at the same time seek to solve the problem of unemployment by increasing the number of jobs in personal services. If these jobs are skilled, paid at normal rates and assured of the same social safeguards as work in the rest of the economy, their number will necessarily be more limited than it is in the USA or <a id="ind320a"/>Japan, or even in <a id="ind618a"/>Sweden.</p><p class="indent">To opt for a policy of RWH thus means opting against both the &#x201C;dual society&#x201D; and the endless proliferation of service jobs, since if these jobs are to have the same reductions in working hours and the same social safeguards as jobs in industry, they will inevitably become more expensive, and this will put a brake on their proliferation. This should not be seen as something negative, since <span class="italic">RWH has meaning only if, by virtue of the time it sets free, it enables people, households and communities to engage in activities which do not have remuneration as their purpose; and among these activities there will naturally be a place, among others, for those which increase each person or community&#x2019;s control over its own immediate environment, its own existence, its own desires and aspirations, its own fulfilment</span>. The desire <span class="italic">to be taken under the wing</span> of professionals or institutions diminishes as the cultural level and standard of living rise and the proportion of time each person has at their own disposal increases. It is supplanted by the desire for personal sovereignty, which expresses itself notably in contesting the hold which professionals, manufacturers, technologies and institutions seek to maintain over people by programming their behaviour, needs, tastes, plans and leisure. In a civilization based on disposable time, where working hours average thirty per week or less (i.e. approximately 1,100 hours per year), the importance of services whose function is to <span class="italic">save time</span> or to compensate for the lack of time <span class="italic">must</span> decline, giving way to activities whose aim is to <span class="italic">spend time</span> taking pleasure in what one is doing and giving, rather than in what one is consuming and receiving.</p><p class="indent">A policy of RWH objectively promotes a greater autonomy on the part of individuals; it must work consciously towards this, and not programme leisure in such a way as to colonize for the benefit of commodity consumption the time that has been set free. A policy of RWH implies that paid work is performed in the main by skilled persons who are well-paid, productive in the economic sense, and socially useful; it therefore implies that servant work, the aim of which is simply to do for others what they could have done just as well in the same time, does not expand.</p><p class="indent">A policy of RWH, therefore, will necessarily be selective in the types of services whose development it promotes. In particular, it will distinguish between cultural services in the broad sense &#x2013; which tend towards the blossoming of personal capacities and of people&#x2019;s ability to take charge of their own lives, existential problems, health, and so on &#x2013; and services essentially performed for profit, which tend to increase commodity consumption and dependency.</p><p class="center0">&#x002A;</p><p class="nonindent"><a id="page111"/>A selectiveness of this kind in the development of the service sector may be achieved through the way in which the RWH is financed. There can be no question of all enterprises increasing the hourly wage of their workers to preserve (at least) their purchasing power when working hours are shortened. In activities where productivity cannot be increased, a 33 per cent rise in staffing levels &#x2013; and thus in the payroll &#x2013; would be required when working hours are reduced by a quarter (to a thirty-hour week). The relative price of services where productivity is stagnant would tend to become exorbitant by comparison with the prices of many industrial products, which are continuing to fall. It must be a prime concern to compensate the wage loss due to shorter hours in a way which does not entail such a distortion of the price system. The solution to this problem will be to let direct wages be reduced as working hours diminish, and to compensate this reduction by an indirect income paid out of a separate public or semi-public fund, on the model of social benefits. For working hours reduced, for example, by 12 per cent, direct wages would be 12 per cent less than they otherwise would have been, but the employees would receive a &#x201C;<a id="ind543a"/>second cheque&#x201D; &#x2013; to use <a id="ind36a"/>Guy Aznar&#x2019;s felicitous expression &#x2013; of 12 per cent.<a id="c09-nts3a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c09_r1GrigorMalogrigormalogmail9410com.htm#c09-nts3"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a> The RWH would not, therefore, increase the cost prices of low-productivity activities, though one might imagine this wage compensation being modulated in such a way as to exclude activities of no social utility (e.g. gaming establishments, personal servants, luxury hotels). Obviously, those performing artisanal activities and services paid for on a job-by-job basis would also be entitled to a second cheque, paid at the &#x201C;going rate&#x201D;.</p><p class="indent">The second cheque cannot be financed by contributions taken from income. That would amount to taking back with one hand what had been given with the other. It cannot be financed by a tax on productivity gains, either (&#x201C;making the machines pay&#x201D;, as the slogan goes): this would amount to having everyone&#x2019;s second cheque paid by the enterprises which make efforts to raise their productivity. They would surely see no reason to keep putting themselves to such pains if the tax system robbed them of the advantages that might be derived. The financing of the second cheque must therefore be fiscally neutral, both for enterprises and for working people. Only one kind of tax can meet this twofold condition in the long term, and that is a tax on consumption, in the form either of VAT or of specific <a id="ind623a"/>taxes (on fuel, motor vehicles, luxuries, alcohol, etc.). This mode of financing will, in the long term, have the added advantage of raising the prices of those industrial products whose cost prices are falling rapidly, but whose increased consumption would not be in the interests of society or individuals, or the conservation of the <a id="page112"/>environment. In the shorter term, it is self-evident that it will be possible to finance the second cheque to a large extent by means of a partial reallocation of unemployment benefits.</p><p class="indent">Obviously, one may envisage more complex formulas, as do the German <a id="ind257a"/>Greens or <a id="ind261a"/>Bernard Guibert, combining income from work and a basic social income payable to all citizens. The chief feature of the German formula is that a &#x201C;binomial&#x201D; monthly income should be paid, made up of a fixed amount of about &#x00A3;405 plus the normal income for twenty hours of weekly work. Bernard Guibert&#x2019;s formula proposes a tripartite income, including a universal allowance (or &#x201C;wage for citizenship&#x201D;) and earnings linked to the quantity and quality of work performed. I believe, however, that the second cheque corresponding to the price of the work which no longer needs to be performed will initially be the most attractive formula.</p><h2 class="section">How are Incomes and <a id="ind325a"/>Jobs to be <a id="ind293a"/>Redistributed?</h2><p class="nonindent">The most complex problem is not, however, that of financing; it concerns the redistribution of the fruits of <a id="ind489a"/>productivity and growth by way of RWH, extra jobs and wage increases. It is not sufficient merely for the legislators to decide an RWH of 10 per cent, for example, for the level of employment to increase automatically by 6 per cent and the level of pay by 2 per cent, as in scenario A 4. That scenario will never be brought about with mathematical precision. The number of jobs created will always be less than 6 per cent. For &#x201C;households&#x201D;, having more time at their disposal, will tend to buy fewer services from professional providers, and the RWH will also speed up the growth in productivity per hour, if only by reducing absenteeism.</p><p class="indent">It is practically impossible, therefore, to forecast the rise in productivity with total accuracy, and select a corresponding RWH. But the impossibility of doing this is far from negative in its implications: it demonstrates that the economy and the society cannot be managed on purely technocratic lines, and that the choice of an RWH will always <span class="italic">initially</span> be a political decision. It is this which must be regarded as an independent variable. It is up to the economy to adapt itself to this, just as it adapted to the Sunday rest day, the eight-hour day, the forty-hour week, paid holidays, and so forth.</p><p class="indent">However, RWH will be translated into a net creation of jobs only if work and incomes can be redistributed from activities where high productivity gains can be made to those in which productivity rises slowly or not at all. That redistribution will be possible only if, for the various types of activity, their growth (or decline) and the development of their <a id="page113"/>productivity can be forecast approximately. Only on this condition will it be possible to orientate workers towards jobs which the RWH will make available when it comes into force.</p><div class="textbox"><p class="center">WHO IS IRREPLACEABLE?</p><p class="textbox">Except in the rare case of the &#x201C;creative genius&#x201D;, a person who is irreplaceable is so only for a limited period. Someone considered indispensable at a particular moment can normally be replaced by another after a period of training and familiarization. Indeed, it is the duty of a coherent democracy to expedite such possibilities of substitution by encouraging access to skills for all, and thus to reject rigidities and fixed patterns in the division of social tasks.</p><p class="right2"><span class="small">JEAN-BAPTISTE DE <a id="ind198a"/>FOUCAULD, LA FIN DU SOCIAL-COLBERTISME</span>, Paris 1988.</p></div><p class="indent">These forecasts cannot, however, be purely statistical. The economy is not a machine which operates in a rigorously determinist fashion. It is the outcome of projects, intentions and programmes. The quality of forecasts and adjustments depends on the translation of the intentions and projects into commitments, contracts, collective agreements at branch and enterprise level. This contractualization has many more advantages than disadvantages (as is evident from the Swedish example in particular). By its mere existence, it reduces uncertainty and produces predictability. Plans and commitments made for several years are, in any case, a necessity for the public services and administrative bodies which have to plan their investments and staffing levels several years in advance. The same is true for most &#x201C;capital-intensive&#x201D; enterprises. The task of a planning body consists precisely in bringing together and harmonizing sectoral plans, and directing overall general development towards the priority goals set by government. Forecasting, dialogue, harmonization and orientation have a regulative, stabilizing effect once they are translated into contractual commitments.</p><p class="indent">However, a contractualization of this kind cannot remain confined to agreements at the top. It will have real impact only if, from the point where the date is set for the implementation of RWH, the <a id="ind642a"/>trade unions and the users&#x2019; and consumers&#x2019; associations rightfully participate, at all levels, in working out the prognoses, plans and overall priorities. This will enlarge the competence of trade unions in a way which has long been advocated in <a id="ind314a"/>Italy and is beginning to be argued for in <a id="ind228a"/>Germany and <a id="ind251a"/>Great Britain, in the name of that &#x201C;<a id="ind150a"/>economic democracy&#x201D; that has <a id="page114"/>been in all the programmes of the European <a id="ind356a"/>Left parties for forty years or more.</p><p class="indent">It is, in fact, impossible to foresee how the structure and level of employment, production priorities, productivity and skills will develop without collective bargaining at branch and enterprise level on the nature and consequences of future technical changes, the modalities of their introduction, the training programmes that will be required, and the changes of skills, working conditions and relations, hours of work, productivity and staffing levels.</p><p class="indent">It is one of the specific aims of an RWH policy to render such collective bargaining necessary. At enterprise and branch level, there must be collective agreements extending over more than a single year and including productivity contracts and contracts relating to staffing levels. Announcing several years in advance that working hours will be substantially reduced at a set date is an extraordinarily effective lever for mobilizing society for what is simultaneously a challenge, an opportunity, a goal and a springboard towards new changes. The stakes for the workers and the interest they can take in this are far more stimulating than anything quality circles have to offer. All the aspects of working conditions are now up for grabs. &#x201C;How will your workshop, office or department operate with an average working week of thirty-five hours (or thirty-two or thirty)? What changes in working hours or in your work station do you think are necessary in the light of the technical changes that are coming? And so on.&#x201D; The &#x201C;workers&#x2019; right to self-expression&#x201D; will assume its full meaning in the context of these discussions and negotiations. Clearly, they presuppose strong trade unions. But, conversely, it is from these discussions and negotiations that the trade unions will draw their strength, as the Swedes, the German metalworkers and the Italians in the CGIL have reason to know.</p><div class="textbox"><p class="center">WIDENING THE SCOPE OF NEGOTIATIONS</p><p class="textbox">The problems which have to be mastered if working hours are to be reduced are too immense and too numerous to be treated in any other way than by wide-ranging negotiations between all the social partners, negotiations carried on simultaneously at several different levels.</p><p class="textbox1">The important thing is to negotiate on the concrete forms the reduction will take, on the productivity and organization of work (particularly machine running hours), on the development of wage and social costs, and on the timetable for the creation of new jobs.</p><p class="textbox1">At the national level, all this implies an invitation to negotiate issued by the government, the establishment of basic guidelines and, then, the <a id="page115"/>conclusion of an interprofessional agreement. The aim of that agreement would be to lay down a general framework within which the social partners would be encouraged to conduct negotiations with a dynamic perspective&#x00A0;&#x2026;</p><p class="textbox1">Ultimately, it is at the level of weekly hours of work and through enterprise-by-enterprise negotiation that one must proceed, to examine on a case-by-case basis how to maintain machine running time, reorganize work, adapt incomes to the changed situation, create new jobs and avoid a deterioration in working conditions.&#x2026;&#x00A0;This presupposes more powerful and better-organized trade unions and managing directors who are prepared to negotiate, and debate on matters which they currently regard as theirs alone to decide. Ultimately, a further step forward in the transformation of industrial relations, such as was begun between 1969 and 1972, has to be achieved.</p><p class="right2">&#x00C9;changes et Projets, <span class="italic">La r&#x00E9;volution du temps choisi</span>. Preface by <a id="ind121a"/>Jacques Delors, Paris 1980.</p></div><p class="nonindent">Of the many questions which still remain to be answered, I shall deal here only with two which relate to problems that arise whenever there is change by stages.</p><p class="indent">1. When the RWH comes into force, extra jobs will become available. These will have to be filled by unemployed people who have received the appropriate <a id="ind648a"/>training or retraining. This does not, however, solve the problem of those enterprises where productivity is growing at a rate equal to or higher than the planned RWH. Before this comes into force, these enterprises will be overstaffed, returning to normal levels only on implementation of RWH. What will they do with a personnel which, at the end of the period, will exceed their needs by, say, 10 per cent? The answer is relatively clear: the staff will be entitled to a training of their choice for a number of hours which increases as the implementation date for RWH approaches. These hours of (professional, artistic, manual, psychological or medical) training will represent a kind of &#x201C;advance&#x201D; against the coming extension of free time, and will prepare them for it. Whether their payment in full for these hours should be met by the &#x201C;<a id="ind544a"/>second cheque&#x201D; or by the enterprises themselves, for which wages generally represent only a small fraction of unit costs, is a question I leave open.</p><div class="textbox"><p class="center"><a id="page116"/>FOR A NEW CONCEPTION OF <a id="ind647a"/>TRADE UNIONISM</p><p class="textbox">We need a political and social project which enables us to bring together all the strata who have an interest in positive social change, but also recognizes the aspirations of the new social subjects. The challenge unions must face up to concerns their ability to put those objectives which are capable of uniting all dependent workers &#x2013; both working and unemployed &#x2013; at the centre of the class struggle&#x00A0;&#x2026;</p><p class="textbox1">To this end, we must offer the marginalized strata new forms of organization which enable them to participate and become mobilized in action, forms which prefigure a horizontal structuring of democracy and unions.</p><p class="textbox1">The organization of leagues of unemployed youth within unions could be one solution. But there are other possible ventures, particularly all the forms of action and association by which young people cannot only demand but themselves create a new relationship between school and work: by deciding the training programmes and the content of the work themselves, and by themselves undertaking to provide services in the public interest&#x00A0;&#x2026;</p><p class="textbox1">In no case must these be regarded as <span class="italic">satellite</span> organizations of the traditional labour movement. The new forms of organization will contribute to the unity of the dependent workers only if they are combined with a transformation of the current organizations of the working class. What is required in reality is a change in the nature of the trade union itself, and a fundamentally new conception of its role. This is what is needed if the unions are to show that they reject the idea of becoming an association of &#x201C;sheltered&#x201D; workers, and are not content just to represent those workers who have steady jobs&#x00A0;&#x2026;</p><p class="textbox1">The unions, industrial unions and their horizontal structures must, in the neighbourhoods, towns and regions, promote &#x201C;structures of movement&#x201D; which organize all the forces of the unemployed, the casually employed, and working students <span class="italic">within</span> the union, to enable these people to have an effective say, from the inside, in the formulation of overall trade-union policy in both the industrial unions and the zonal councils&#x00A0;&#x2026;</p><p class="right2">Extract from <span class="italic">Il Sindicato dei Consigli</span> (Rome 1980) by <a id="ind652a"/>Bruno Trentin, current general secretary of the CGIL.</p></div><p class="indent">2. In the period preceding the RWH, the resources that are to be made available, when the time arrives, for creating extra jobs must not be used to pay the existing workforce. Levels of payment cannot, therefore, rise as quickly as they would without an RWH with net creation of jobs. To achieve such a moderation or limitation of wage rises, there <a id="page117"/>is no need to limit the scope of collective bargaining in an authoritarian manner. In any event, authoritarian attempts to restrain trade-union autonomy have never been successful in the long term. The moderation of wage claims will, rather, be the product of the trade unions&#x2019; decision progressively to include within the scope of their bargaining those people who are not yet employed, and who are being prepared to occupy the jobs which the RWH will make available. In other words, <span class="italic">those waiting to take up jobs have to be involved in trade-union life and collective bargaining</span>. Negotiations must be extended to cover their rights, their pay and the nature and length of their training. I leave open the question of how these trainees who will receive a job when RWH is implemented are to be paid &#x2013; whether this should be from the usual social benefits, by the &#x201C;<a id="ind545a"/>second cheque&#x201D; and/or from contributions paid by employers and employees. The same rules and proportions do not necessarily have to apply in all branches.</p><p class="indent">Thus I am not proposing a limitation of the trade unions&#x2019; bargaining power but, on the contrary, a <span class="italic">trade-union policy</span> on economic, fiscal and employment matters, on social priorities, on the model of consumption, the quality of life and the environment. This enhancement of the scope of trade-union activity is necessary if trade unions are not merely to degenerate into mutual aid societies for the well-to-do, and if industrial struggles at enterprise and industry level are to have more than merely sectional interests at their base. Far from paralysing trade unionism in an institutional role, trade-union policy can, as I have just demonstrated, extend the workers&#x2019; control over the whole field of working conditions.</p><h2 class="B_HEAD">Notes</h2><div class="note_hang"><p class="note_hang" id="c09-nts1"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_c09_r1GrigorMalogrigormalogmail9410com.htm#c09-nts1a">1.</a> This is a reworking of an article published in October 1989 in <span class="italic">Partage</span>, the monthly paper of the unemployed workers&#x2019; union.
