</head><body><h1 class="B_HEAD" id="prf"><a id="pagevii"/><a id="ind586a"/>Preface</h1><p class="nonindent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">As a system, socialism is dead. As a movement and an organized political force, it is on its last legs. All the goals it once proclaimed are out of date. The social forces which bore it along are disappearing. It has lost its prophetic dimension, its material base, its &#x201C;historical subject&#x201D;; History and the technical changes that are leading to the extinction, if not of the proletariat, then at least of the <a id="ind727a"/>working class, have shown its philosophy of work and history to be misconceived.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">Between 1961 and 1988, the size of the industrial working class shrank by 44 per cent in Great Britain, 30 per cent in <a id="ind199a"/>France, 24 per cent in Switzerland and 18 per cent in West Germany. In the space of twelve years (1975&#x2013;86), one-third or even half of all industrial jobs have disappeared in several European countries. During those twelve years, French industry did away with almost as many jobs as it created between 1890 and 1968.<a id="prf-nts1a"/><a class="hlink" href="#prf-nts1"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">During the same period, a great number of jobs have been created in the <a id="ind552a"/>service sector; but these are often part-time and/or precarious, low-skilled jobs, which offer no opportunities for career development and bear no relation to what constituted the essence and value of work and the workers in socialist doctrine. It is as though the industrial working class had declined and been partially supplanted by a post-industrial &#x2013; largely female &#x2013; proletariat which, by dint of the precariousness of its condition and the nature of its tasks, cannot derive from its work either a social identity or a mission to wield economic, technical or political power.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">In short, work has <a id="ind705a"/>changed, and the &#x201C;workers&#x201D; have changed too. We may ask what proportion of the workforce would still define their identity in terms of their work and their working <a id="ind747a"/>lives. Or what proportion still regard their work as the focus of their lives. France is one <a id="pageviii"/>of the rare countries that exhibits no desire to answer these questions: no newspaper or magazine, polling institution, trade union, employers&#x2019; organization, ministry or university research centre carries out studies into the way attitudes to work are changing, or into ideas about work and life. I shall therefore take the results of the most recent survey published in West <a id="ind216a"/>Germany, where, it must be remembered, industrial relations and working conditions are notoriously better than in France: only for 15 per cent of those questioned (35 per cent of senior managers) did their professional life still take priority over their personal life. For the immense majority, their work is no longer their life. It is no longer either qualitatively or quantitatively the focus of their life.</p><p class="extract EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">From the quantitative point of view, working lives are beginning later, ending earlier and being interrupted more frequently; at the same time, <span class="italic">annual, full-time</span> working hours fell from 2,150 in 1960 to 1,650 in 1990, and a further 150 hours can be deducted from this figure for sick leave. This amounts to a 23 per cent <a id="ind210a"/>reduction in individual, annual, <span class="italic">full-time</span> working hours over a thirty-year period. Now, during those thirty years (I am still using the German figures), the annual volume of work (i.e. the total number of hours worked by all the members of the workforce) fell by 28 per cent, whilst production per hour of work increased threefold, and unemployment &#x2013; or, rather, the impossibility of &#x201C;earning a living&#x201D; &#x2013; assumed disquieting proportions.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">What, in these conditions, is a Left perspective? What does it mean, in these conditions, &#x201C;to be a socialist&#x201D;? If it means fighting for the emancipation of the <span class="italic">workers</span>, then socialists are merely the elitist ideological spokespersons for those 15 per cent who still define themselves chiefly by their work, who feel they are workers first and foremost, and experience their work as an activity that is at least potentially fulfilling and creative. But should not socialism precisely make <span class="italic">all</span> work a creative and fulfilling activity? I certainly agree that it should be so, provided that we do not forget that &#x201C;employment&#x201D; &#x2013; paid, productive work &#x2013; occupies a proportion of our time (less than one-fifth of our waking lives) which is declining ever more rapidly, and that unpaid activities &#x2013; whether necessary or freely chosen, private or social &#x2013; cannot, in all honesty, be equated with that &#x201C;work&#x201D; on which the consciousness of belonging to the working class was built &#x2013; the awareness of having interests, as a worker, which are opposed to those of capital.<a id="prf-nts2a"/><a class="hlink" href="#prf-nts2"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a> Not all work is work in the same sense of the term. Not all work is a source of social identity or class belonging.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">In these conditions, how are we to understand the future place of employment in the life of individuals and society? What is the future for <a id="pageix"/>a civilization whose increasingly efficient technologies create more and more wealth with less and less labour? Can we exit from the wage-based society without society as such being riven by antagonisms between an increasingly opulent group of privileged individuals and an ever-growing number of social outcasts. Can the wage-based society be saved by increasing the number of jobs which the founding fathers of political economy termed unproductive? Can it be saved by indefinitely continuing to monetize, professionalize and turn into paid occupations even the most basic daily activities? Or do we not have to find a source of activity and mode of social integration to replace wage-labour? Must we not go beyond the society of full employment and plan for a &#x201C;full activity&#x201D; society in which each person&#x2019;s income is no longer the price for which they <span class="italic">sell</span> their labour?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">Does not this exit from the wage-based society throw capitalism itself, as an economic and social system, into question? Is it not for want of being formulated, comprehended, taken in hand by a political project, that such a questioning takes the negative form of disorientation, of an absence of perspective, a sense of insecurity and emptiness? Does it not seem more urgent than ever, now that the Soviet model has collapsed, to get beyond capitalism to a society in which the economic values of efficiency, profitability and competitiveness cease to be dominant, to a society which <span class="italic">makes use of</span> the economy for its own higher ends instead of being forced to serve it?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">The term &#x201C;<a id="ind581a"/>socialism&#x201D; no longer refers to any existing <span class="italic">social order</span>, nor even to any <span class="italic">model of society</span> that can be brought into being in the long or short term. Does this mean, then, that the socialist perspective and the reference to socialism have lost all meaning? Can we forget that capitalism dominates the world economy without needing to offer the world a social <span class="italic">order</span> or <span class="italic">model</span> of society? Can we allow ourselves to forget that our societies <span class="italic">are</span> capitalist societies, and that socialism does not need to define itself in terms of another social system existing elsewhere: it defines itself as opposition to capitalism &#x2013; that is, as a radical critique of forms of society in which the social balance of forces, decision-making processes, technology, work, structures of everyday life, patterns of consumption and models of development all bear the stamp of a concern for the greatest possible profitability.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">Abandoning the reference to socialism would lead also to abandoning any reference to a desirable &#x201C;beyond&#x201D; of capitalism, would lead us to accept this latter as &#x201C;natural&#x201D; and unchangeable, and to speak with a naive idealism of democracy and justice whilst treating as a negligible quantity the economico-material matrix of capital which, because it necessarily demands profitability above all, cannot help but be a source of domination, alienation and violence.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart"><a id="pagex"/>So long as we have no other term by which to refer to the transcending of capitalism (a transcending which must not be confused with the abolition of capital &#x2013; a point to which I shall return below), the reference to socialism will have to be retained &#x2013; on condition, however, that we redefine it. J&#x00FC;rgen <a id="ind263a"/>Habermas argues along these same lines when he writes that socialism as &#x201C;radical-reformist self-criticism of capitalist society&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#x00A0;will only disappear when the object of its criticism disappears&#x201D; &#x2013; that is to say, &#x201C;when the society being criticized is transformed to the point where it will be able to grasp the importance of, and take seriously, all those things that cannot be expressed as a sale or purchase price&#x201D;.<a id="prf-nts3a"/><a class="hlink" href="#prf-nts3"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a></p><h2 class="B_HEAD">Notes</h2><div class="note_hang"><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart" id="prf-nts1"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_prf_r1GrigorMalogrigor4395malogmailcom.htm#prf-nts1a">1.</a> On this question, see Emmanuel Todd, <span class="italic">L&#x2019;invention de l&#x2019;Europe</span>, Paris 1990.</p><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart" id="prf-nts2"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_prf_r1GrigorMalogrigor4395malogmailcom.htm#prf-nts2a">2.</a> See Chapters 6, 7 and 8 below.</p><p class="note_hang EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart" id="prf-nts3"><a class="hlink" href="Gorz_9781781680384_epub_prf_r1GrigorMalogrigor4395malogmailcom.htm#prf-nts3a">3.</a> J&#x00FC;rgen Habermas, &#x201C;Was heisst Sozialismus heute?&#x201D;, in Habermas (ed.), <span class="italic">Die nachholende Revolution</span>, Frankfurt-am-Main 1990, p. 203.</p></div><p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: center; color: #666; border-top: 1px solid #9a9a9a; padding: 15px 0 0; margin: 50px 0 0;" class="EPubfirstparagraph epubpagerstart">This eBook is licensed to Grigor Malo, grigormalo@gmail.com on 09/13/2018</p></body></html>
